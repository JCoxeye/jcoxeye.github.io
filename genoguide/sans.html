			<h2>Preface</h2>
				<p><span class="b">Sans Undertale</span>.<br>The ultimate test of any <em animSubType="rainbow">True <i>Undertale</i> Gamer</em>.</p>
				<p><span class="b">Sands Thundersnail</span> is quite the challenge, especially if you don't know what to expect, nor how the fight even works.</p>
				<p>That's where this guide comes in.</p>
				<p>Below, I will explain the mechanics of <span class="b">Sadge Trogdorfail</span>'s fight, which strategies work and which don't, and show all of his attacks.</p>
				<p>This guide limits spoilers for the remainder of the <span class="r">No Mercy</span> route, but it does have a section related to <a href="#speedrunning" class="o">Speedrunning</a>, found at the bottom of the page.</p>
				<p>The following sub-sections will be organized by their relevance to the average player.</p>
			
		</section>
		
		<section id="basics">
			
			<h2 class="">The Basics</h2>
				<p><span class="b">Chives Mustardkale</span> has only <span class="g">1 HP</span>, <span class="c">1 ATK</span>, and <span class="b">1 DEF</span>, so he would normally be a very easy enemy.</p>
				<p>To make up for this, he bends the rules of the game to get an advantage:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Although the battle is still turn-based, he takes his turn first.</li>
					<li>Just as you (attempt) to dodge his attacks, he dodges your attacks as well, making your <span class="c">AT STAT</span> useless against him.</li>
					<li>He ignores invincibility frames, damaging you for <span class="g">1 HP</span> every frame, for <span class="b">30 Damage</span> per second. Because he only deals <span class="b">1 Damage</span> at a time, your <span class="b">DF STAT</span> is useless as well.</li>
					<li>
						He also inflicts a poison effect called <span class="p">KARMA</span>, in the form of additional purple damage that is slowly converted into actual damage.
						<br>
						When you're first hit by an attack, you'll accrue an amount of <span class="p">KR</span> equal to that attack's
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									<span class="p">Innate KR</span>,
								</span>
								<span class="poppupAside">
									How much any given attack has is shown in the <span class="b">Attacks</span> section.
								</span>
							</span>
						in addition to an extra
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									<span class="p">30 KR</span>
								</span>
								<span class="poppupAside">
									(That is, <span class="p">1 KR</span> per frame)
								</span>
							</span>
						per second while you're still being hit by it.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some other important notes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As he dodges your attacks, he slowly gets more and more tired; attacking him is necessary to progress the fight. Do note that using consumables does not progress the fight, so using them to heal will extend it.</li>
					<li>Importantly, although <span class="b">Saul Goodman</span> usually ignores <span class="c">AT</span> and <span class="b">DF</span>, certain equipment can still be used to give yourself an advantage, as discussed in the <a href="#equipment" class="p">Equipment</a> section.</li>
					<li>In the <span class="b">Blue SOUL mode</span>, if you press the 'jump' button mid-air and keep holding it until you land, you'll jump as soon as you touch the ground.<br>Using this, you can effectively queue your jumps ahead of time, removing the need to time them.</li>
					<li>The rate at which <span class="p">KARMA</span> is converted to damage is highly variable, but in general, <span class="p">KR</span> drains faster as you have more of it, and slower as you have more <span class="p">INV</span>.</li>
				</ul>
			
		</section>
		
		<section id="equipment">
			
			<h2 class="p">Equipment</h2>
				<p>Given <span class="b">Franz Ferdinand</span>'s <span class="r">STAT</span>s and unique mechanics, <span class="c">ATK</span> and <span class="b">DEF</span> are useless against him - <span class="b">DF</span> doesn't reduce the damage you take, and <span class="c">AT</span> doesn't affect the turn length of the battle.</p>
				<p>With that, the only weapons and armor that affect the battle are ones that give special effects, those being:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									<span class="g">Burnt Pan</span>:
								</span>
								<span class="poppupImage poppupImage640">
									<img src="../assets/images/itemLocations/burntPan.gif" width="640" height="480">
								</span>
							</span>
						Gives all of your healing items an extra <span class="g">4 HP</span> of healing, which amounts to at most <span class="g">32</span> extra <span class="g">HP</span> to work with throughout the fight, depending on the items at your disposal.
					</li>
					<li>
						The
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									<span class="p">Torn Notebook</span>:
								</span>
								<span class="poppupImage poppupImage640">
									<img src="../assets/images/rooms/waterfallCrossroads.png" width="640" height="480">
								</span>
							</span>
						Provides a very slight amount of <span class="p">INV</span> (immunity frames after getting hit). By my guess, it'll reduce the damage you take by ~1/15 of what you normally would.
					</li>
					<li>
						The
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									<span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span>:
								</span>
								<span class="poppupImage poppupImage640">
									<img src="../assets/images/rooms/waterfallCrossroads.png" width="640" height="480">
								</span>
							</span>
						Provides a slightly higher amount of <span class="p">INV</span>, preventing roughly ~1/12 of the damage you take.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Finally, using both the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span> and <span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span> at the same time reduces damage even further (preventing roughly ~1/9 of damage taken), and slows the rate at which <span class="p">KARMA</span> is converted to damage.</p>
				<p>Given all of that, which should you choose?</p>
				<p>Well, given that the <span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span> are the only armor item that actually do anything against <span class="b">Cans</span>, you should always be using them.</p>
				<p>As for the weapon, most say that the <span class="g">Burnt Pan</span> is the best, but they're likely unaware of the effect that <span class="p">INV</span> has during the fight.</p>
				<p>The other useful weapon to use is the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span>, which effectively gives you more defense, while also slowing the rate at which <span class="p">KARMA</span> drains your <span class="g">HP</span>.</p>
				<p>Either choice is valid, but I would suggest the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span>:<br>The extra ~<span class="g">25</span>-<span class="g">30 HP</span> you'll get via the <span class="g">Burnt Pan</span> is probably not much more than the <span class="g">HP</span> you'll save by taking less damage, if at all. Plus, healing loses you a turn, and in my experience, most people beat <span class="b">Pan's Worsethanbook</span> with a consumable or two left in their inventory anyway.</p>
				<p>Speaking of...</p>

			<h2 class="g">Consumables</h2>
				<p>In the <span class="y">MTT</span> Resort, one can buy Legendary Heroes, which heal <span class="g">40 HP</span>.<br>With that, the only relevant consumables are ones that heal more than <span class="g">40 HP</span>, or have special effects:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Pie: Heals <span class="g">MAX HP</span>, can only be obtained once, from
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									<span class="r">Toriel</span>'s home.
								</span>
								<span class="poppupImage poppupImage640">
									<img src="../assets/images/itemLocations/pie.gif" width="640" height="480">
								</span>
							</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						Instant Noodles: Heals <span class="g">90 HP</span>, can only be obtained once, from
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									<span class="y">Alphys</span>' fridge.
								</span>
								<span class="poppupImage poppupImage640">
									<img src="../assets/images/itemLocations/instantNoodles.gif" width="640" height="480">
								</span>
							</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						Snowman Pieces: Heals <span class="g">45 HP</span>, can only be obtained thrice, from
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									the Snowman partly through Snowdin Forest.
								</span>
								<span class="poppupImage poppupImage640">
									<img src="../assets/images/rooms/snowmanCliff.png" width="640" height="480">
								</span>
							</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						Legendary Heroes: Heals <span class="g">40 HP</span>, from the <span class="y">MTT</span>-Brand Burger Emporium for <span class="y">300G</span>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Sea Tea: Heals <span class="g">10 HP</span>, increases <span class="o">SPEED</span> (movement speed while dodging attacks), from
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									<span class="y">Gerson</span>'s Shop for <span class="y">18G</span>.
								</span>
								<span class="poppupImage poppupImage640">
									<img src="../assets/images/rooms/waterfallCrossroads.png" width="640" height="480">
								</span>
							</span>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Provided you haven't used the Pie, Instant Noodles, or Snowman Pieces, you should have three spaces open for Legendary Heroes and/or Sea Tea.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you've already used the Snowman Pieces, don't worry - having at most <span class="g">15</span> less <span class="g">HP</span> to work with isn't a big deal.<br>If you've already used the Pie or Instant Noodles, <b animSubType="shake">may <span class="elemHoly">The Angel</span> have mercy on your SOUL.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					As for the remaining spaces in your inventory, just fill them up with Legendary Heroes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Trading a Legendary Hero for a Sea Tea to get the <span class="o">SPEED</span> bonus is often recommended, as it can be a lifesaver for his harder attacks.<br>I'd say two Sea Teas is too much however, as sacrificing <span class="g">30 HP</span> for diminishing returns really isn't worth it.

			<h2 class="b">Dodging Attacks</h2>
				<p>Arright. This is what you've been waiting for.</p>
				<p>There's quite a high demand for guides for these attacks, as this is by far the most difficult fight in the game.<br><a href="https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/" target="blank">You can even find a whole online simulator for this!</a></p>
				<p>Of course, that so-called 'bad time simulator' is just a simulator - it doesn't show you the <em animSubType="rainbow">Pro Gamer Strats</em>!<br><s>and also the emulation is terrible oh my god why is it like that</s></p>
				<p>Anyway, here's all of <span class="b">Stan Millvale</span>'s attacks done without getting hit, and strategies for each!</p>

							<span class="b">Seven Granddad</span>'s opening attack.
						</p>
						<p>
							I recommend using only <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> for this entire attack; using <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd> is unnecessary, and will only make dodging it more complicated.

							He then creates a Bone Hallway for you to squeeze through. At this point, you'll probably already be in position to dodge this if you dodged the last part properly.
						</p>
						<p>
							After this, <span class="b">Sam Jaundice</span> summons several sets of <span class="gray">Gaster Blasters</span>, creating safe spots for you to dodge them:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The first set makes a box around the center; simply move towards the center after dodging the last part of the attack.</li>
							<li>The second set makes an 'x' shape across the <span class="r">Bullet Board</span>. You can dodge this either by going all the way up or all the way down.</li>
							<li>The third set is another box shape, dodged the same way as last time.</li>
							<li>The fourth set is two large <span class="gray">Gaster Blasters</span> shooting left and right, dodged the same way as the 'x' shape.</li>
						</ol>

							Sets of vertical bones will shoot towards the center of the <span class="r">Bullet Board</span>, forcing you to jump between the small gaps.
						</p>
						<p>
							Again, I recommend only using <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> for this attack. Pressing <kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Right</kbd> will severely screw with the timing, making the attack nigh impossible to dodge.

						</p>
						<p>
							This one is quite hard to dodge, especially if you don't know how to do it to begin with.
						</p>
						<p>
							There's only a small window of time to jump over the small white bone after the <span class="c">blue bone</span> passes you, and the next <span class="c">blue bone</span> forces you to make as small a jump as possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							This attack is made much easier by moving with the bones as you jump, giving you just enough time to land before the next <span class="c">blue bone</span> movement-checks you.
						</p>
						<p>
							Importantly, after the third small white bone, the attack switches directions; after jumping over the third white bone, start shifting to the right to give yourself more time to react to the set coming from the left.

							In this attack, the gaps are all random distances from the ground, requiring more reaction speed, and (slightly) less precision.

						<p>
							This is simple at first, but the third <span class="b">platform</span> has bones jutting out from the 	ceiling above.

							The continuation of the last attack.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's mostly the same at first, albeit headed in the opposite direction.
						</p>
						<p>
							The big difference comes in with a large extra bone with a <span class="b">platform</span> above, sitting in between the first and second <span class="b">platforms</span>.
							<br>
							You can jump onto the high <span class="b">platform</span> if you want, but you can also just jump all the way to the next one, making the attack quite a bit simpler.
						</p>
						<p>
							Next comes three <span class="b">platforms</span> with bones above them, like the third <span class="b">platform</span> from the previous attack.
							<br>
							Like last time, you'll have to come in at a sharper angle so you don't get hit by the bones above.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once you're on the first of these <span class="b">platforms</span>, you'll notice a large bone coming from the left, which limits the time you have to finish the attack.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thankfully, getting to the second <span class="b">platform</span> only requires moving off the edge of the first - you'll land right on it, without having to do an otherwise tricky jump.
						</p>
						<p>
							After a small hop to the third of these <span class="b">platforms</span>, a large bone will come from the right, forcing you to squeeze above it, landing on the clear ground below. You'll have to wait for the perfect moment, as the ceiling prohibits a larger jump.

						<p>
							This ends up being one of <span class="b">Shams</span>' hardest attacks due to its random nature.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sets of <span class="b">platforms</span> come in two rows, dividing the play field into three rows for you to stand in.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the top and bottom rows, bones come from the right, while the middle row has bones coming from the left.
						</p>
						<p>
							These bones sweep across the entire row, forcing you to vacate to one of the surrounding rows.
						</p>
						<p>
							I recommend disregarding the top row entirely. You can avoid the entire attack by just moving between the bottom two rows.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once you've exited the bottom row, try getting back to it as soon as the coast is clear. Doing this will save you the trouble and brainpower of having to deal with the moving <span class="b">platforms</span>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Note the movement pattern here - stay in one row, moving with the bones, until you're forced to move to the other row, switching directions. You'll notice this ends up making a big circle pattern. Recognizing this will come in handy for later attacks.

							In this attack, you'll start on a single moving <span class="b">platform</span> above a 'Bone Ocean'.
						</p>
						<p>
							This joyride is interrupted by three columns of bones that force you to weave between the gaps.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you know the attack well, you'll know when to jump and when to sit in place on the platform, but, since I know you, I'll save you the trouble and tell you outright.
						</p>
						<p>
							When moving to the right, jump to pass through the gaps of the first column, coming to a rest on the left side of the <span class="b">platform</span>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Then, move to the right side of the <span class="b">platform</span> to pass through the second bone column and cruise through the third.
						</p>
						<p>
							Then, once you're past the third column, line yourself up with the right side of the <span class="b">platform</span>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Lining it up right isn't as precise as you might expect, and you can push against the right wall of the <span class="r">Bullet Board</span> help with this.
							<br>
							Doing this, you'll simply cruise back through the bones, no problem.
						</p>
						<p>
							Notably, this attack is timed such that once you're back in between the left and middle columns, you can simply do a full jump directly upwards to run out the clock, saving you the trouble of dodging the left column again.

						<p>
							In this attack, large bones above move to the left, while small bones below move to the right.
						</p>
						<p>
							Stay on the ground, moving to the right with the small bones, before doing a full jump to the left, moving with the big bones. You may need to shift a little bit to the side so you don't hit a small bone as you're falling back down.
							<br>
							Rinse and repeat.

						<p>
							Depending on how full your jumps are, you'll either clear the entire thing with only two jumps, or you may need to do an extra one or two.

						</p>

								The hardest mini attack, bar none. You start on top of the upper of two <span class="b">platforms</span>, above a 'Bone Ocean'. A bone comes towards you from either the left or right, forcing you off of the upper <span class="b">platform</span> and onto the one below.
							</p>

								While that happens, a second bone is headed from the opposite direction towards the lower <span class="b">platform</span>, forcing you to jump off of that <span class="b">platform</span> as well.

							<p>
								Like the Bone Slide attacks, the key is to make a circle motion - move off of the upper <span class="b">platform</span>, then turn back to land on the lower <span class="b">platform</span>, jumping off of it as soon as possible.
							</p>
							<p>
								Do note that you don't have to jump off of the top <span class="b">platform</span>. It's easier to just slide off without jumping.

								Provided you jump from the lower <span class="b">platform</span> without hitting either of the top two bones, you're safe, as the attack will end before you fall below.

							In my opinion, this attack and its upgraded versions are <span class="b">Smear Campaign</span>'s hardest attack.
						</p>
						<p>
							You'll be thrown towards a wall of the <span class="r">Bullet Board</span>, and upon landing a set of bones will come out of the wall you were thrown into, forcing you to quickly react and jump out of the way.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's already very difficult to react to, and in later iterations of the attack a full jump is required, further diverting your attention.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, you'll only have to deal with that if you don't do the Pro Gamer Strats!

							hold all four arrow keys at the same time.

							Yeah, that's literally it.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's basically free.

						<p>
							Of course, if you're some sort of PLEBIAN and use a controller or a keyboard that doesn't accept that many inputs at once, you're gonna have to suck it up and dodge it the normal way.

							Regardless of how you dodge it though, do note that there are 9 <span class="b">Gravity Slams</span> per attack, and that once it's over, you'll have to start dodging menu bones again.

							Sets of bones appear that block portions of the <span class="r">Bullet Board</span>, requiring you to dodge up and down just like the Bone Hallway, albeit with much more precise timing.

						<p>
							For both of these, if you're on a keyboard, I recommend switching to moving up and down with two fingers and alternating with them, as opposed to moving your middle finger between the arrow keys every time.

						<p>
							You may have noticed that the bones in first half of the 'Turbo Tunnel' are spaced out.

						<p>
							This can be used to your advantage; by holding right to immediately jump off of the left wall after the vertical <span class="r">Bone Slide</span>, you'll be positioned to fit in between the gaps, effectively nullifying that portion of the attack:

			<h2>On the Topic of <span class="p">INV</span> and <span class="p">KARMA</span></h2>
				
				<p>If you're anything like me, discovering the niche specifics of random things in <i>Undertale</i> is a highly enjoyable experience, not to mention a vaguely useful one from a theorycrafting/speedrunning perspective.</p>
				<p>This section will cover <span class="p">INV</span> and <span class="p">KARMA</span> in detail, explaining the intricacies of things that only the most brain-rotten of <i>Undertale</i> fans would care for.</p>
				
				<h3>What's <span class="p">INV</span>?</h3>
					<p>Your <span class="p">INV STAT</span> represents how long you're invincible after taking damage.</p>
					<p>Your <span class="p">INV</span> starts at <span class="p">30</span> (1 second of invincibility), but you can get some more by equipping the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span> or <span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span>, bought from <span class="y">Gerson</span>'s shop in Waterfall.</p>
					<p>The in-game descriptions of the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span> and <span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span> <strong animSubType="wave">say</strong> they give <span class="p">6</span> and <span class="p">9 INV</span> respectively, but upon equipping them, you'll notice that they clearly increase your <span class="p">INV STAT</span> by much more than just <span class="p">15</span> (1/2 of a second).</p>
					<p>So... what's up with that?</p>
					<p>Well, to put it bluntly, the statistics the game gives you are <em animSubType="wave">blatently false</em>, and have literally nothing to do with the actual <span class="p">INV STAT</span>.</p>
					<p>Diving into the code, we can confirm the

						<p>(<kbd>gml_Object_obj_sansb_body_Draw_0</kbd>)</p>
						<p>This is the code that's largely responsible for how <span class="p">INV</span> works against <span class="b">Grains Andtheseeds</span>. It's a little more complicated than the last one, but here's how I think it works:</p>
						<p><kbd>inv_timer</kbd> (which starts at <kbd>0</kbd>) is increased by <kbd>1</kbd> every frame.</p>
						<p>If you don't have increased <span class="p">INV</span>, then this doesn't do anything - you never get any i-frames.<br>If you do, though, then you'll be given one frame of invincibility every time the counter reaches a certain number, dependent on your <span class="p">INV</span>:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If you have <span class="p">45 INV</span>, this number is <kbd>5</kbd></li>
							<li>If you have <span class="p">60 INV</span>, this number is <kbd>4</kbd></li>
							<li>If you have <span class="p">75 INV</span>, this number is <kbd>3</kbd></li>
						</ul>
						<p>Effectively, you're immune to <span class="b">Direct Damage</span> (<strong animSubType="wave">not</strong> <span class="p">KARMA</span>) 1/5 of the time when using the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span>, 1/4 of the time when wearing the <span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span>, and 1/3 of the time when using both the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span> and the <span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span>.</p>
					
					<h3>What's <span class="p">KARMA</span>?</h3>
						<p>When you're first hit by an attack, you'll be hit for <span class="b">1 DMG</span> and accrue a sizeable amount of <span class="p">KARMA</span>, dependent on the attack's
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									<span class="p">Innate KR</span>.
								</span>
								<span class="poppupAside">
									How much any given attack has is shown in the <span class="b">Attacks</span> section.
								</span>
							</span>
						<br>Afterwards, for as long as you're in contact with the attack, you'll take an additional <span class="b">1 DMG</span> and <span class="p">1 KR</span> per frame, for a total of <span class="b">30 Direct Damage</span> and <span class="p">30 KARMA</span> per second.
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									(?)
								</span>
								<span class="poppupAside">
									For example, let's say you're hit by an attack that has <span class="p">6 Innate KR</span>, and are in contact with the attack for a third of a second (10 frames).<br><br>On the first frame, you'll be hit for <span class="b">1 DMG</span> and accrue <span class="p">6 KR</span>.<br><br>You'll then take another <span class="b">1 DMG</span> and <span class="p">1 KR</span> on each of the following 9 frames, for a total of <span class="b">9 DMG</span> and <span class="p">9 KR</span>.<br><br>Overall, you'll take <span class="b">25 DMG</span>: <span class="b">10</span> from <span class="b">Direct Damage</span>, and <span class="p">15</span> from <span class="p">KARMA</span>.</span>

						<p>This code is <em animSubType="wave">even more</em> complicated, but here's how my <strong animSubType="rainbow">smooth brain</strong> interprets it:</p>
						<ol>
							<p>Your <span class="p">KARMA</span> is capped at <span class="p">40</span>, and then to 1 less than your current <span class="g">HP</span>; you can't have more than <span class="p">40 KR</span>, nor more <span class="p">KR</span> than <span class="g">HP</span>.</p>
							<p>If you have some amount of <span class="p">KR</span> and aren't dead, <kbd>km_t</kbd> (henceforth '<span class="r">KARMA Timer</span>') increases by <span class="r">1</span> every frame.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>If you aren't using any <span class="p">INV</span>-boosting items, then <kbd>km_bonus</kbd> (henceforth '<span class="r">KARMA Timer Bonus</span>') is set to <span class="r">0</span>.</li>
								<li>If you have <span class="p">45 INV</span>, then the <span class="r">KARMA Timer Bonus</span> is set to either <span class="r">0</span> or <span class="r">1</span>, with a 50/50 chance for either.</li>
								<li>If you have <span class="p">60 INV</span>, then the <span class="r">KARMA Timer Bonus</span> has a 1/3 chance of being set to <span class="r">0</span>, and a 2/3 chance of being set to <span class="r">1</span>.</li>
								<li>If you have <span class="p">75 INV</span>, then the <span class="r">KARMA Timer Bonus</span> is set to <span class="r">1</span>.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Depending on your current <span class="p">KR</span>, the <span class="r">KARMA Timer</span> is compared to one of several time limits. Once it meets that time limit, you'll take <span class="b">1 Damage</span>, lose <span class="p">1 KR</span>, and the <span class="r">KARMA Timer</span> will be set back to <span class="r">0</span>.</p>

								These time limits are as follows:

						<p>In short, and as mentioned earlier, <span class="p">KARMA</span> drains faster as you have more of it, and slower as you have more <span class="p">INV</span>.</p>

						<p>(<kbd>gml_Object_obj_sansb_body_Draw_0</kbd>)</p>
						<p>The code you see here is from the first part of <span class="b">Trans Cringefail</span>'s in-battle
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									Draw Event.
								</span>
								<span class="poppupAside">
									In GameMaker Language (GML), a Draw Event is how an object represents ('draws') itself on-screen.<br><br>If it seems strange that this code is inside of a Draw Event instead of a Step Event (the gameplay counterpart to Draw Events), then you'd be right.<br><br>I have no idea why Toby Fox made it this way.
								</span>
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>As Draw Events are run every frame, the code that governs the <span class="r">KARMA Timer</span> is run every 1/30th of a second. This would be fine on its own, if it weren't for the fact that the code that sets the <span class="r">KARMA Timer Bonus</span> is <em animSubType="wave">also</em> run every frame.</p>
						<p>This means that while you have only one <span class="p">INV</span>-boosting item equipped (I.e, you have <span class="p">45</span> or <span class="p">60 INV</span>), <kbd>km_bonus</kbd> is randomly set to either <kbd>0</kbd> or <kbd>1</kbd> <b animSubType="wave">30 times per second</b>.</p>
						<p>You may have realized the problem.</p>
						<p>If <kbd>km_bonus</kbd> is randomized each frame, then the variables that depend on it (such as the time limit that <kbd>km_t</kbd> needs to reach) will <em animSubType="wave">also</em> be random each frame.<br>Given that <kbd>km_t</kbd> only needs to be above the time limit for a single frame, these random fluctuations are more than enough to cause <span class="p">KARMA</span> to tick down and reset the timer.</p>
					
					<h4>Effectively:</h4>
						<p>The code is <em animSubType="wave">supposed</em> to mean that, when you equip only one <span class="p">INV</span>-boosting item, whether any given point of <span class="p">KARMA</span> takes longer to tick down is random.</p>
						<p>What ends up <em animSubType="wave">actually</em> happening is that, once the <span class="r">KARMA Timer</span> passes the
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									minimum time limit,
								</span>
								<span class="poppupAside">
									(That being the time limit if you weren't using any <span class="p">INV</span>-boosting items)
								</span>
							</span>
						there's a chance for <span class="p">KARMA</span> to tick down <em animSubType="wave">each frame</em> until the
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									maximum time limit
								</span>
								<span class="poppupAside">
									(That being the time limit if you were using both <span class="p">INV</span>-boosting items)
								</span>
							</span>
						is reached.</p>
						<p>Ultimately, wearing only one <span class="p">INV</span>-boosting item barely affects the rate at which <span class="p">KARMA</span> is converted to damage.</p>

			<h2>Fun Factoids</h2>
				<p>Various fun facts and extraneae regarding the fight:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As previously mentioned, provided you hit <span class="b">Heads Ortails</span> at every opportunity, you won't ever see the '<span class="b">Faster Blaster Platforms</span>' attack.</li>
					<li>The first and third sets of menu bones are usually dodged by waiting to select the option. If you're using the Linux or Mac version 1.001 however, it's possible to dodge the attack by pressing <kbd>Z</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> on one frame, and then pressing the other the next frame, which doesn't give the top bone an opportunity to hit you.</li>
					<li>The Temmie Armor, which grants <span class="p">15 INV</span>, is usually unobtainable in the <span class="r">No Mercy</span> route. Due to the fact that the code doesn't differentiate between <em animSubType="wave">how</em> you get the <span class="p">INV</span>, the Temmie Armor still grants an amount of protection against <span class="b">Samsung Galaxy</span>'s attacks.</li>
					<li>Similarly, both the Temmie Armor and the <span class="g">Stained Apron</span> restore <span class="g">1 HP</span> every other turn, and if cheated in, they could both be marginally useful in their own right.</li>
					<li>'<span class="r">Cross Blasters</span>' and '<span class="r">Diagonal Blasters</span>' are technically considered the same 'Mini Attack' in the code, but are different enough for me to separate them in the previous list.</li>
					<li>Contrary to popular belief, the Instant Noodles healing <span class="g">90 HP</span> is not unique to the <span class="b">Fools Golderpail</span> fight. It's actually a product of a battle state called <span class="r">Serious Mode</span>, which is active against <span class="r">Toriel</span>, <span class="r">Asgore</span>, <span class="r">Asriel</span>, <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span>, and of course, <span class="b">Tans</span>.</li>
					<li><span class="p">KR</span> is never stated to stand for '<span class="p">Karmic Retribution</span>', either in-game or in the code - that's just a fanon misconception.</li>
					<li>The part of the 'Finale' attack that I referred to as the 'Turbo Tunnel' appears to be a reference to the obstacle of the same name from <i>Battle Toads</i>; it's infamous for being ridiculously difficult and precise, much like the <i>Undertale</i> version.</li>
					<li>While you're being slammed against the walls after the 'Finale' attack, holding into a wall that you're falling parallel to will cause you to take <span class="b">1 Damage</span> per frame.</li>
					<li>Pope Francis of the Holy Catholic Church has fought <span class="b">Mans Undermale</span>. It's true; my absent scientist father who exclusively wears turtlenecks works at the Vatican.</li>

			<h2 class="o">Speedrunning</h2>
				<p>In the <span class="r">Genocide</span> category of <i>Undertale</i>, <span class="b">Sans Deltarune</span> functions as the final skill-check between you and your (hypothetical) PB.</p>
				<p>Of course, you'll have the <span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span> and <span class="r">Bandage</span> equipped, unless you've equipped another armor for safety.</p>
				
				<p>Three things are important to get a good fight:</p>
				<ol>
					<p><em animSubType="wave">Equip the</em> <span class="b"><b animSubType="wave">Ballet Shoes</b></span>:<br>The <span class="g">Burnt Pan</span> or <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span> may be tempting, but the amount of time you lose to the longer attack animations isn't really worth it.<br>Plus, if you need either of those to be safe during the fight, you should probably put in a bit more practice - you should be <b animSubType="wave">very confident</b> in fighting <span class="b">Clash of Clans</span> before running <span class="r">Geno</span>.</p><!--Git Gud-->
					<p>Don't waste any turns doing anything other than attacking:<br>Aside from when he <span class="y">SPARE</span>s you, healing will waste a turn, which is a lot of time to lose, especially against <span class="b">Hans Olo</span>.<br>Of course, if you absolutely need to heal, it's better to do so than die. Do recall that after you heal, the cursor will still be on the <span class="p">ITEM</span> option. Try not to heal again, or worse, reequip the <span class="g">Burnt Pan</span>.</p>
					<p><em animSubType="rainbow">MASH</em>:<br>The attack minigame and the battle dialogue can be mashed, as neither are important to the fight. The opening and ending monologues aren't mashable though, so don't bother; just press <kbd>Z</kbd>.<br>Do note that as battle dialogue, <span class="b">Some Dumbass</span>' monologue can be mashed at 30 TBPS.</p>
				</ol>
				
				<h3>Safety Concerns:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You should probably heal at a <span class="r">SAVE Point</span> some time before the fight. The Judgement Hall <span class="r">SAVE Point</span> is fine, especially if you need a safety <span class="r">SAVE</span>, but the <span class="r">SAVE</span> in front of <span class="r">Asgore</span>'s House is better, as you don't need to go out of your way to interact with it.</li>
					<li>You might want to equip the <span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span>: they're good safety for <span class="b">Bronze Platemail</span>, and aren't too out of the way.<br>If you do pick them up, you should equip them at the same time you equip the <span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span> just before <span class="y">Mettaton NEO</span>, as opposed to right away.<br>You already have to menu there, and equipping them early can make it harder to flee from extra CORE encounters.</li>
					<li>You also might find it worth it to get the Pie, as it's another <span class="g">MAX Heal</span> like the Instant Noodles. Do note that the Instant Noodles are easier to get, though; the only reason why you should get the Pie over the Noodles is to have extra safety for <span class="y">Undyne</span>, and if you don't do <a href="https://youtu.be/eUaOHWOKYyM" target="_blank">Early <span class="g">Burnt Pan</span></a>.</li>
