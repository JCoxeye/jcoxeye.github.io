			<h1><span class="b">JCoxeye</span>'s Guide to Fighting <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span></h1>
				<p>This will be a comprehensive guide to defeating <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span>, including strategies relating to leveling, equipment, using consumables, and dodging attacks.</p>

		<section id="preface">
			
			<h2 class="y">Preface</h2>
				<p>As you're no doubt aware, <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span> is a pretty difficult boss.</p>
				<p>She has fast and complicated attacks, which require a large amount of memorization and skill. There's no substitute for being good at the game, but '<strong animSubType="wave">git gud</strong>' and '<em animSubType="wave">bash your head against the wall until you get it</em>' aren't very helpful in terms of advice.</p>
				<p><b animSubType="shake">That's where this guide comes in.</b></p>
				<p>This guide assumes you have played <i>Undertale</i>'s <span class="g">True Pacifist</span> route to completion, have started a <span class="r">Genocide</span>/<span class="r">No Mercy</span> route, and are looking for a comprehensive explanation/strategy guide for the fight with <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span>.</p>
				<p>This guide limits spoilers for the remainder of the <span class="r">No Mercy</span> route, but it does have a section related to speedrunning, found at the bottom of the page.</p>
				<p>The following sub-sections will be organized by their relevence to the average player.</p>
			
		</section>
				
		<section id="equipment">
			
			<h2 class="p">Equipment</h2>
				<p>
					Of all of the equipment available up to <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span>, four stand out among the rest:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span> (<span class="c">7 AT</span>), found in the
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									Glowing Blue Marsh room
								</span>
								<span class="poppupImage poppupImage640">
									<img src="../assets/images/itemLocations/balletShoes.gif" width="640" height="480">
								</span>
							</span>
						in Waterfall.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="b">Old Tutu</span> (<span class="b">10 DF</span>), found in the
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									Falling Rocks room
								</span>
								<span class="poppupImage poppupImage640">
									<img src="../assets/images/itemLocations/oldTutu.gif" width="640" height="480">
								</span>
							</span>
						near the beginning of Waterfall.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="p">Torn Notebook</span> (<span class="c">2 AT</span>, <span class="p">6 INV</span>), sold by <span class="y">Gerson</span> in
							<span class="poppup">
								<span class="poppupTrigger">
									his Shop
								</span>
								<span class="poppupImage poppupImage640">
									<img src="../assets/images/rooms/waterfallCrossroads.png" width="640" height="480">
								</span>
							</span>
						for <span class="y">55 G</span>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span> (<span class="b">5 DF</span>, <span class="p">9 INV</span>), sold by <span class="y">Gerson</span> in his Shop for <span class="y">30 G</span>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Note that once you fall into the dump, backtracking to get the <span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span> and <span class="b">Old Tutu</span> becomes impossible.
				</p>
				<p>
					As you can see, the <span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span> and <span class="b">Old Tutu</span> provide better <span class="c">ATK</span> and <span class="b">DEF</span>, but the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span> and <span class="p">Glasses</span> provide extra <span class="p">INV</span>.
					<br>
					You may be wondering what these <span class="r">STAT</span>s do in practice. Well, I'll tell you!
				</p>
				<p>
					The following assume an <span class="r">LV</span> of <span class="r">10</span>. Note that <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span> has <span class="g">23000 HP</span>:
				</p>
				
				<h3><span class="c">AT</span>:</h3>
					<h4><span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span>:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="c">~1700 Damage</span> for a perfect attack</li>
							<li><span class="c">~1500 Damage</span> for a good attack</li>
							<li><span class="c">~1100 Damage</span> for an okay attack</li>
							<li><span class="c">~600 Damage</span> for a bad attack</li>
						</ul>
						<p>I can't accurately guess how good you'll be with the <span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span>, but by my guess, assuming you don't use any turns to heal, it'll probably take about ~18 turns (you'll see ~17 attacks). If you're good with the <span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span>, you can expect to see about 15-16 attacks.</p>
					
					<h4><span class="p">Torn Notebook</span>:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="c">~1400 Damage</span> for a perfect attack</li>
							<li><span class="c">~1150 Damage</span> for a good attack</li>
							<li><span class="c">~850 Damage</span> for an okay attack</li>
							<li><span class="c">~600 Damage</span> for a bad attack</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Again, I can't be sure of your skill level, but I think it'll probably take about ~21 turns (you'll see ~20 attacks). If you're good with the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span>, you can expect to see 17-18 attacks.</p>
				
				<h3><span class="b">DF</span>:</h3>
					
					<h4><span class="b">Old Tutu</span>:</h4>
						<p><span class="b">8</span>-<span class="b">12 Damage</span> per hit, with an average of <span class="b">~9.75 Damage</span> (you'll die after taking ~5.75 hits).</p>
					
					<h4><span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span>:</h4>
						<p><span class="b">8</span>-<span class="b">13 Damage</span> per hit, with an average of <span class="b">~10.5 Damage</span> (you'll die after taking ~5.33 hits).</p>
				
				<h3><span class="p">INV</span>:</h3>
					<p>Your <span class="p">INV STAT</span> determines how long you're invincible after being hit by an attack. Each point of <span class="p">INV</span> is one frame that you're invincible.</p>
					<p>As <i>Undetale</i> runs at thirty frames per second, each point of <span class="p">INV</span> is 1/30th of a second of invincibility.</p>
					<p>You normally have <span class="p">30 INV</span>, but against <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span>, you have one less <span class="p">INV</span> per <span class="r">LV</span>, meaning you'll probably have about <span class="p">~20 INV</span>.</p>
					<p>Based on
						<span class="poppup">
							<span class="poppupTrigger">
								their descriptions,
							</span>
							<span class="poppupAside">
								<span class="p">Torn Notebook</span>:<br>'* "Torn Notebook" - Weapon AT 2<br>* Contains illegible scrawls.<br>* Increases INV by 6.'<br><br><span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span>:<br>'* "Cloudy Glasses" - Armor DF 6<br>* Glasses marred with wear.<br>* Increases INV by 9.'<br>'* (After you get hit by an attack, you stay invulnerable for longer)'
							</span>
						</span>
						one might assume that the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span> and <span class="p">Glasses</span> would give <span class="p">6</span> and <span class="p">9 INV</span> respectively, but that's actually not the case.<br>In reality, they give <span class="p">15</span> and <span class="p">30 INV</span> respectively - a <em animSubType="wave">very</em> potent buff that will save your, uh, grass.</p>
					<p>Wearing both will give you <span class="p">45 INV</span>, which will over <strong animSubType="wave">triple</strong> your <span class="p">INV STAT</span>. The <span class="p">Glasses</span> alone will still give you over <b animSubType="wave">twice</b> the <span class="p">INV</span>, so wearing them is still more than worth it even without the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span>.</p>
				
				<h3 class="p">Equipment Closing Thoughts</h3>
					<p>
						Having either the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span> or <span class="p">Cloudy Glasses</span> adds <em animSubType="wave">loads</em> of i-frames, and having both adds even more, so the extra <span class="p">INV</span> is almost always worth it in <em animSubType="wave">some</em> capacity.
					</p>
					<p>
						With that said, the extra attacks you'll have to endure by using the <span class="p">Torn Notebook</span> instead of the <span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span> can get you killed, especially given how much harder the attacks start getting.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since the <span class="p">Glasses</span> add more <span class="p">INV</span> anyway, if you're gonna use only one <span class="p">INV</span> boosting item, it should probably be the <span class="p">Glasses</span>.
					</p>
					<h4>As for the three remaining sets (<span class="b">Shoes</span> + <span class="b">Tutu</span>, <span class="b">Shoes</span> + <span class="p">Glasses</span>, <span class="p">Notebook</span> + <span class="p">Glasses</span>):</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>I would recommend using the <span class="b">Shoes</span> and <span class="p">Glasses</span>. The <span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span> reduce the turn length of the battle by a lot, and the extra i-frames are a lifesaver.</li>
							<li>If you don't get too much use out of the extra i-frames, getting hit by spaced out attacks, try using the <span class="b">Shoes</span> and <span class="b">Tutu</span> instead.</li>
							<li>Alternatively, if you find yourself dying too quickly, getting hit by a bunch of attacks in a row, try using the <span class="p">Notebook</span> and <span class="p">Glasses</span> instead.</li>
						</ul>

				<h3>Which of these are the most useful, you ask?</h3>
					<p>Well, before we talk about that, let's first discuss the Pie and Snowman Pieces.</p>
					<p>As you've probably guessed, <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span> is not the last super difficult fight in the <span class="r">No Mercy</span> route.</p>
					<p>Without getting into spoiler-ey specifics:<br><strong animSubType="wave">Do not use the Pie.</strong><br>Its <span class="g">MAX HP</span> heal is too good to 'waste' on <span class="y">Undyne</span>.</p>
					<p>As for the Snowman Pieces:<br>If using the Snowman Pieces is what allows you to defeat <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span>, use them. It is better to progress than to vainly attempt to save every last bit of <span class="g">HP</span> for later fights.<br>With that said, it's better to avoid using them if you can.</p>
				
				<h3>Aside from those, what is the best 'loadout'?</h3>
					<p>Well, just fill up your inventory with the most powerful healing items you can get your hands on (listed above).<br>Obviously, leave the Pie (and Snowman Pieces if you're saving them) in the box.
					<p>Leave at <b animSubType="wave">most</b> 1-2 slots open for Sea Tea, if you're gonna use it. As for whether or not you should?<br>It's up to personal preference, but I would recommend taking only one: it helps, but two offers diminishing returns.</p>
					<p>As for Dog Salad, the possibility of an extra bit of <span class="g">HP</span> isn't worth the added RNG, IMO, but it's definitely not an invalid (or even sub-optimal) strategy, especially if you're gonna replace Crab Apples with it. The real issue is how tedious it is to get...</p>

				<p>This is the part of the guide where you get a visual explanation.</p>

					<p>A harder version of the <span class="r">Spinning Spear Circle</span> attack that has 8 <span class="r">spears</span> rather than 6.</p>
					<p>This is <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span>'s hardest attack in my opinion. I barely managed to get footage of not getting hit by it.</p>
					<p>A good strategy is to stay mostly still, and look for openings. Once you've found one, go for it, making sure to account for the spinning of the <span class="r">spears</span> (remember that the <span class="r">spears</span>' spinning slows down as they closer to you).</p>
					<p>You could try to make a consistant strategy like the last version of this attack, but that's made difficult due to how long it takes to show up; personally, I end up just winging it.</p>

					<p>Like the last attack, this attack is a retread of earlier, but faster.</p>
					<p>This time, I show this attack's cheese strategy:<br>by moving to the (almost) pixel-perfect spot shown, you won't even need to dodge.</p>
					<p>This is made easier by holding the 'back' button (<kbd>X</kbd> by default): it slows down your movement, making it easier to get into just the right position.</p>
					<p>I would recommend trying to dodge the attack normally if you're not used to dodging the attack this way, though.<br>It's better to expend a bit more effort dodging than trying and failing to do a cheese strat.</p>

				<h3>You may notice, however, that if you go into your <span class="r">STAT</span>s menu, it will look something like this:</h3>

					<p>To find your "true" <span class="r">STAT</span>s, add them together, then add <span class="r">10</span>.</p>
					<p>Why add <span class="r">10</span>?</p>
					<p>Because the <span class="r">STAT</span>s menu lies to you.</p>
					<p>No, really: it says your base <span class="c">AT</span> and <span class="b">DF</span> are <span class="r">10</span> lower than they should be, making it seem like you start at <span class="c">0 AT</span> and <span class="b">0 DF</span>.<br>Why it does this, I do not know.</p>
					<p>Anyway, the <em animSubType="wave">actual</em> base attack and defense for this example are <span class="c">28 AT</span> and <span class="b">12 DF</span>.

					<li>In Snowdin Town, steal as many Cinnamon Bunnies as you need for <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span>.</li>
					<li>Aside from the Quiche, you'll have 7 inventory slots for healing against her; you should have a combined total of 7 jugs of Spider Cider and Cinnamon Bunnies in your box.</li>

					<li>Afterwards, in the large Bridge Seed Puzzle room, build a bridge to the right to get the Abandoned Quiche.</li>
					<li>Once you enter the Glowing Blue Marsh area after the telescope room, go to the left to find the <span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span>.</li>
					<li>Once you've exhausted Waterfall's <span class="r">Kill Count</span> (<span class="r">18</span>), do some inventory management in front of and in <span class="y">Gerson</span>'s Shop.</li>
					<li>In the box, you should have the Pie, Snowman Pieces, and whatever equipment you're not using.</li>

			<div id="speedrunningContent" class="dropDownContent">
				<p>Let's say you've already beaten <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span>, and are looking to speedrun <i>Undertale</i>.</p>
				<p>Given that you're just starting out, you'll probably be running either the <span class="y">Neutral Glitchless</span> or <span class="r">Genocide</span> categories of the game.<br>In that case, you'll not only have to fight <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span>, but you'll also have to get good at it.</p>
				<p>As you may already be aware, if you're being optimal, you'll have the <span class="b">Ballet Shoes</span> and <span class="r">Bandage</span> while fighting <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span>, and you'll be at <span class="r">LV 10</span>.</p>
				<p>To get an optimal fight, you'll need to do 2 things:</p>
				<ol>
					<p>Deal as much damage as you can to kill <span class="y">Undyne the Undying</span> as fast as possible:<br>a 14-turn fight is optimal, and in doing so you'll skip having to sit through her last few attacks.<br>If you miss it, you'll see the <span class="r">Random Arrows</span> attack, which is unfortunate, but perfectly acceptable unless you're trying to squeeze every last inch out of the fight.<br>The <span class="r">Simple Spear Circle</span> attack right after however, is <strong animSubType="wave">very</strong> lengthy - try to avoid seeing this attack if at all possible.</p>
					<li>Not get hit while in the <span class="g">Green SOUL</span> mode:<br>Internally, <span class="y">Undyne</span> has a 'Challenge' statistic, which keeps track of how fast the arrows are in the <span class="g">Green SOUL</span> mode.<br>Getting hit lowers the challenge level, slows the arrows down, and makes all of her <span class="g">Green SOUL</span> mode attacks take longer.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Outside of the fight itself:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You can <span class="r">SAVE</span> in the hallway with Echo Flowers just before the bridge room if you're not super confident. Even if you don't <span class="r">SAVE</span>, taking the safety heal might be a good idea anyway.</li>
					<li>When you enter the bridge room, make sure to move down a pixel to avoid getting stuck on the bridge!<br><b animSubType="shake">(I'm getting angry just thinking about that stupid bridge...)</b></li>
					<li>You can mash the attack indicators to hit Monster Kid - the accuracy doesn't matter.</li>
					<li>All of Monster Kid and <span class="y">Undyne</span>'s pre-fight dialogue is mashable, but <em animSubType="wave">not</em> the dialogue when <span class="y">Undyne</span> first transforms, <em animSubType="wave">nor</em> the dialogue when you deal the final hit, so don't bother mashing through it.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>If you need some safety for the fight:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You can get the Snowman Pieces in Snowdin.<br>If you get these, grind for an extra encounter before and after going into the Snowman room.</li>
					<li>You can get the <span class="b">Old Tutu</span> at the beginning of Waterfall.<br>If you get it, you won't be able to run away from encouters as easily, most notably Vulkin and Tsundereplane later in <span class="y">Neutral Glitchless</span>, or extra enemies in the CORE in <span class="r">Genocide</span>.</li>
					<li>If you're looking for an intermediate safety strat, try buying the <span class="p">Glasses</span> and a couple of Crab Apples from <span class="y">Gerson</span>.<br>If you buy these, note that the <span class="p">Glasses</span> also make fleeing harder, but not as hard as with the <span class="b">Tutu</span>. They'll also help later with some extra defense and <span class="p">INV</span>.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Oh, and one more thing:</h3>
				<p>If you use a healing item in battle, when the enemy finishes their attack, the curser will still be on the <span class="p">ITEM</span> option. If you're used to quickly pressing <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to attack, the you'll end up selecting and using the first item in your inventory.</p>
				<p>At best, you'll waste the Pie/Instant Noodles (and a turn), and at worst, you'll eat the Spider Donut in <span class="y">Neutral Glitchless</span>.</p>
				<p><b animSubType="shake">Do not eat the Spider Donut in <span class="y">Neutral Glitchless</span>.</b></p>
				<p>Doing so will force you to kill Muffet and watch her ~20 second long death animation.</p>
