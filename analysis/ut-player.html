			<h2>Preface</h2>
				<p>
					<i>Undertale</i> is a game whose story has several particularly 'meta' aspects, i.e. narrative events and details that either reference or outright acknowledge the fact that <i>Undertale</i> is a video game.
				</p>
				<p>
					This document attempts to establish and define several terms and scenarios, and use these definitions to analyze <i>Undertale</i> 's diegesis, namely in regards to the player's relevance to the story.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before proceeding, I'd like to acknowledge Andrew Cunningham's video regarding <i>Undertale</i> 's diegesis:
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDJqO__RliM"><i>What was so good about UNDERTALE, anyway? (A mildy deranged retrospective)</i></a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The following document regards many concepts that this video introduces (and explains in much finer, more comprehensible detail), so I'd highly recommend watching it before proceeding.
				</p>

			<h2>Definitions</h2>
				
				<h3>Real World Non-diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						The game world asserts that the player and their world is non-existent.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player may be meant to embody a particular character, perhaps even crafted by themself in their own image, but the player themself, as a human playing a game, is not real.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Real World Diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						The game world acknowledges that the player and their world is existent.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player is expected not to embody any character whatsoever, outside of themselves. The game world acknowledges the player as a human being in a different or higher plane of existence, even if the characters themselves do not.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Game World Diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						The game world asserts that the game world and the events therein are real.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player is expected to suspend their disbelief over the existence of said world and events.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Game World Non-Diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						The game world acknowledges itself as a video-game, thereby denying its own existence as a real world.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player is not expected to suspend their disbelief over the game world or its events.
					</p>
			
		</section>
		
		<section id="scenarios">
			
			<h2>Differing Scenarios</h2>
				
				<h3>Real World Diegesis; Game World Non-diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						This is, in effect, reality; the true state of events.
					</p>
					<p>
						Video games are not real; you, reading this, are. Any game asserting this scenario would thereby accept its existence as a video game.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Real World Non-diegesis; Game World Diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						The standard state of the suspension of disbelief.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player (or audience of most pieces of fiction) is expected to temporarily forget their own reality, and suspend their disbelief over the unreality of the fictional world and its events.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the particular case of video games, the player may be meant to embody certain characters (Link in <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> ; custom characters in, say, <i>Terraria</i> ; etc.). This, however, does not mean the game truly acknowledges the player or their world as existent.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Real World Diegesis; Game World Diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						This is a unique state of events wherein the game world acknowledges the player and their world as existent, whilst simultaneously upholding the reality of the game world and its events. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This then implies that the player, although expected to maintain their existence, is also expected to believe that they are not simply playing a game. 
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, they instead may be expected to believe they are using a program on their device to monitor and influence events in another parallel reality or far-away place.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Real World Non-diegesis; Game World Non-diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						This would imply that the player is expected to forget their own existence, while simultaneously not accepting the existence of the game world. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I don’t know what this entails, exactly. Moving on.
					</p>
			
		</section>
		
		<section id="examples">
			
			<h2>Examples</h2>
				
				<h3><i>Terraria</i></h3>
					<p>
						<i>Terraria</i> is an example of Real World Non-diegesis and Game World Diegesis.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player is not acknowledged as existing in any capacity; only the character the player creates is acknowledged as existing.
					</p>
					<p>
						While said character may be made to represent the player, and/or embodied by the player, this relationship is not acknowledged, and within the logic of the game world, the character is simply a character.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, <i>Terraria</i> never casts doubt on the idea that its world is real.
					</p>
				
				<h3><i>The Legend of Zelda</i></h3>
					<p>
						<i>The Legend of Zelda</i> is another example of Real World Non-diegesis and Game World Diegesis.
					</p>
					<p>
						Link is a pre-existing character within the world, and there is no doubt cast that Hyrule (the setting of the series) is not real.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, although the player is meant to embody Link to a certain extent, there is no acknowledgement of the distinction between Link and the player; within the logic of the game world, Link is simply Link.
					</p>
				
				<h3><i>Earthbound</i></h3>
					<p>
						<i>Earthbound</i> is an example of Real World Diegesis and Game World Diegesis.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player, by the end of the fight against Giygas, is expected to believe that they, a human being in front of a television screen, is interfacing with a real world via said television screen.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player is directly acknowledged as existing, and there is no indication that the world of <i>Earthbound</i> believes itself to be unreal.

			<h2><i>Undertale</i> 's Diegesis</h2>
				<p>
					Firstly, let's establish <i>Undertale</i> 's position on its own world: it's fairly clear that <i>Undertale</i> believes its own world to be real. There’s no indication that it believes itself to be unreal, and more than enough reason to think that it believes itself to be a real world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, let’s discuss <i>Undertale</i> 's position on the player and their world (i.e. our world); this is where it gets a little unclear.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are some key points to keep in mind:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>At the end of the True Pacifist route, it is revealed that the human you name at the beginning of the game is actually the first fallen human (henceforth 'Chara'), who befriended Asriel.</li>
						<li>This name appears on the SAVE File, and in battle.</li>
						<li>Then, Flowey addresses the player as 'Chara' ('See you later… Chara.'), speaking of Frisk in the third person ('Let Frisk live their life.').</li>
						<li>At the end of the Genocide/No Mercy route (henceforth simply 'No Mercy route'), Chara speaks to us in the second person. ('It was you who pushed everything to its edge.').</li>
						<li>Chara then asserts that they are in control in some way ("SINCE WHEN WERE YOU THE ONE IN CONTROL?").</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
					The first thing to note about these is that Frisk is evidently not simply 'us'. The True Pacifist route makes this fairly clear: Frisk is their own person, who we simply control.
				</p>
				<p>
					From there, ignoring points #4 and #5, it seems reasonable to think that we are therefore meant to embody Chara:<br>
					The player 'is' Chara, who then controls Frisk. Note that this is effectively Real World Non-diegesis, albeit with a protagonist that is analogous to an actual player.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a slightly bizarre arrangement, sure, but it very naturally explains Chara's name appearing throughout the game, and why Flowey outright calls us 'Chara'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Point #4 complicates things, however. After all, Chara speaks of themself in the first person, while addressing us in the second person.
				</p>
				<p>
					This then implies that the player is diegetic to <i>Undertale</i>. Either we diegetically control Frisk, and Chara's along for the ride, or we diegetically control Chara, who then controls Frisk.
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, the way I see it, we have two major questions right now:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Is the player diegetic?</li>
						<li>Does the player control, whether diegetically or not, Frisk or Chara?</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
					From here, there's four possibilites:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The player is diegetic and controls Frisk.</li>
						<li>The player is diegetic and controls Chara, who then controls Frisk.</li>
						<li>The player is non-diegetic and controls Frisk.</li>
						<li>The player is non-diegetic and controls Chara, who then controls Frisk.</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
					Now, let's dissect each of these options, and consider what they entail.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Diegetic Player Controlling Frisk</h3>
					<p>
						This possibility is a pretty natural way to have the player control Frisk without 'being' them or Chara.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, this scenario assumes that:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Flowey is simply wrong in his assumption that Chara is in control at the end of True Pacifist.</li>
							<li>Chara's name on the SAVE File and in battle simply comes from their presence, as opposed to their control.</li>
							<li>Chara's "SINCE WHEN WERE YOU THE ONE IN CONTROL?" spiel does not actually mean that they're  in control of Frisk; only that they have some amount of power.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				
				<h3>Diegetic Player Controlling Chara</h3>
					<p>
						This scenario implies that the player controls Chara, who then controls Frisk.
					</p>
					<p>
						This adequetly addresses Frisk and Chara as separate entities from the player, Flowey's dialogue, and Chara's name appearing on the SAVE File and in battle.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, this scenario is bizarrely complicated; it introduces a lot of narrative complexity for seemingly no reason, aside to account for various independant details.
						<br>
						That is to say, this feels less like a cohesive narrative idea and more like a band-aid covering up a plot contrivance.
					</p>
					<p>
						This makes this scenario less desirable, but not impossible, especially given other <i>Undertale</i> plot contrivances (see: essence lore).
					</p>

		<section>
				<p>
					First, I’ll address possibilty #3.
				</p>
				<p>
					From what I can tell, this scenario is largely used as a way to diegetically explain the player's knowledge of <i>Undertale</i> during the events of <i>Deltarune</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					That is, <i>Deltarune</i> seems to canonize the player, and the player is meant to have experienced <i>Undertale</i> beforehand.
					<br>
					Therefore, <i>Deltarune</i> 's player-entity 'is' <i>Undertale</i> 's player entity, which then implies that Undertale has a player-entity.
				</p>
				<p>
					That tracks to some extent, but it relies on the idea that <i>Deltarune</i> even has a 'player-entity' as opposed to simply believing the player, as a human playing <i>Deltarune (20XX, hopefully)</i>, exists (that is, Real World Diegesis again).
				</p>
				<p>
					This has a major flaw:
					<br>
					If Real World Diegesis can accommodate <i>Undertale</i> 's story, and can hypothetically accommodate <i>Deltarune</i> 's player knowing about <i>Undertale</i>, then why bother?
					<br>
					What reason is there to invent a 'player-entity' that stands in for the player, as opposed to simply… believing the player actually exists and has experienced <i>Undertale</i> ?
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly, let’s address possibilities #1 and #2.
				</p>
				<p>
					#1 argues that what appears to be a relatively major lore reveal is simply a fourth wall break with minimal connotations.
				</p>
				<p>
					This may read as ignoring major evidence for the sake of keeping a particular interpretation afloat, but it’s largely a way to avoid #2, specifically the apparent contradictions therein.
				</p>
				<p>
					So then, if we can dispel some of those contradictions, then not only will we get closer to a particular answer, we’ll also effectively eliminate the need for another.
				</p>
				<p>
					So what are these contradictions?
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Real World Diegesis inherently implies Game World Non-diegesis, thereby undermining the game’s story.</li>
						<li>Flowey refers to the player as 'Chara' in True Pacifist (refer to key point #4).</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
					Firstly, as described in the <a href="#scenarios">Scenarios</a> section, <em class="wave">I simply disagree</em> that Real World Diegesis and Game World Diegesis are incompatible scenarios; the player may be expected to believe they are accessing the real, parallel world of <i>Undertale</i> via their device, as opposed to playing a video game named '<i>Undertale</i> '.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second contradiction, effectively, implies that Chara is indeed a 'player-entity' in control of Frisk. This idea is supported by their name appearing on the SAVE File and in battle; Chara being in control fairly naturally explains both of these.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, during the No Mercy route, and especially in its ending, it's implied (if not outright stated) that Chara is indeed in control in some form.
				</p>
				<p>
					From there it follows that there’s no need for the player to be diegetic, because Chara is already analogous to the player.
					<br>
					Assuming there’s a player on top of that implies a sort of daisy chain of control, wherein we diegetically control Chara, who then controls Frisk.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'd argue that this isn’t an impossible scenario, but it is bizarrely complicated, so it’s best avoided if possible. This then leaves us in a unfortunate situation where both options are fairly unpalatable.
				</p>
				<p>
					So unpalatable, in fact, that I think it's worth re-capping all of our options, even ones previously dismissed, to see how they all stack up with each other.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are our six disappointing options:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The player is non-diegetic to the world of <i>Undertale</i>, and we are simply represented by Chara's presence with Frisk. This ignores the No Mercy route's ending.</li>
						<li>The player is indeed diegetic to <i>Undertale</i>, and is in control of Chara, who is then in control of Frisk. This is bizarrely complicated, and has a weird amount of narrative complexity for no apparent reason.</li>
						<li>The player is diegetic to <i>Undertale</i>, and is meant to be in control of Frisk. Chara, then, is simply along for the ride. This doesn't really explain Chara's name appearing on the SAVE File and in battle, and assumes that Flowey is simply wrong when he assumes that Chara is in control.</li>
						<li>The player is not diegetic to <i>Undertale</i>, and is actually simply meant to 'be' Frisk. Chara is once again only along for the ride. This ignores the True Pacifist route's apparent insistence that Frisk is their own person, in addition to the concessions of Disappointing Option #3.</li>
						<li>The player is not diegetic to <i>Undertale</i>, and is meant to embody an unnamed, ambiguous third party character, who controls Frisk as described in Dissapointing Option #3.</li>
						<li>Ditto, except that said third party character controls Chara as described in Dissapointing Option #2.</li>
					</ol>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					Now that the options have been laid out, which is most likely?
				</p>
				<p>
					First, I argue that the True Pacifist route's ending can not simply be ignored; #4 is off the table, in my opinion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, as described above, I see no reason to assume the involvement of a 'non-player player' as in #5 and #6.
					<br>
					Again, why introduce an ambiguous and unnamed character to stand in for the player, as opposed to simply assuming the player exists?
				</p>
				<p>
					Third, I feel that, given how #2 fairly adequetly avoids any direct contradiction as far as I can tell, #1's bla
