			<h2>Preface</h2>
				<p>
					<i>Undertale</i> is a game whose story has several particularly 'meta' aspects, i.e. narrative events and details that either reference or outright acknowledge the fact that <i>Undertale</i> is a video game.
				</p>
				<p>
					This document attempts to establish and define several terms and scenarios, and use these definitions to analyze <i>Undertale</i> 's diegesis, namely in regards to the player's relevance to the story.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before proceeding, I'd like to acknowledge Andrew Cunningham's video regarding <i>Undertale</i> 's diegesis:
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDJqO__RliM"><i>What was so good about UNDERTALE, anyway? (A mildy deranged retrospective)</i></a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The following document regards many concepts that this video introduces (and explains in much finer, more comprehensible detail), so I'd highly recommend watching it before proceeding.

			<h2>Definitions</h2>
				
				<h3>Real World Non-diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						The game world asserts that the player and their world is non-existent.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player may be meant to embody a particular character, perhaps even crafted by themself in their own image, but the player themself, as a human playing a game, is not real.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Real World Diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						The game world acknowledges that the player and their world is existent.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player is expected not to embody any character whatsoever, outside of themselves. The game world acknowledges the player as a human being in a different or higher plane of existence, even if the characters themselves do not.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Game World Diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						The game world asserts that the game world and the events therein are real.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player is expected to suspend their disbelief over the existence of said world and events.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Game World Non-Diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						The game world acknowledges itself as a video-game, thereby denying its own existence as a real world.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player is not expected to suspend their disbelief over the game world or its events.
					</p>

			<h2>Differing Scenarios</h2>
				
				<h3>Real World Diegesis; Game World Non-diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						This is, in effect, reality; the true state of events.
					</p>
					<p>
						Video games are not real; you, reading this, are. Any game asserting this scenario would thereby accept its existence as a video game.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Real World Non-diegesis; Game World Diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						The standard state of the suspension of disbelief.
					</p>
					<p>
						The player (or audience of most pieces of fiction) is expected to temporarily forget their own reality, and suspend their disbelief over the unreality of the fictional world and its events.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the particular case of video games, the player may be meant to embody certain characters (Link in <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> ; custom characters in, say, <i>Terraria</i> ; etc.). This, however, does not mean the game truly acknowledges the player or their world as existent.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Real World Diegesis; Game World Diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						This is a unique state of events wherein the game world acknowledges the player and their world as existent, whilst simultaneously upholding the reality of the game world and its events. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This then implies that the player, although expected to maintain their existence, is also expected to believe that they are not simply playing a game. 
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, they instead may be expected to believe they are using a program on their device to monitor and influence events in another parallel reality or far-away place.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Real World Non-diegesis; Game World Non-diegesis</h3>
					<p>
						This would imply that the player is expected to forget their own existence, while simultaneously not accepting the existence of the game world. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I don’t know what this entails, exactly. Moving on.

			<h2><i>Undertale</i> 's Diegesis</h2>
				<p>
					Firstly, let's establish <i>Undertale</i> 's position on its own world: it's fairly clear that <i>Undertale</i> believes its own world to be real. There’s no indication that it believes itself to be unreal, and more than enough reason to think that it believes itself to be a real world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, let’s discuss <i>Undertale</i> 's position on the player and their world (i.e. our world); this is where it gets a little unclear.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are some key points to keep in mind:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>At the end of the True Pacifist route, it is revealed that the human you name at the beginning of the game is actually the first fallen human (henceforth 'Chara'), who befriended Asriel.</li>
						<li>This name appears on the SAVE File, and in battle.</li>
						<li>Then, Flowey addresses the player as 'Chara' ('See you later… Chara.'), speaking of Frisk in the third person ('Let Frisk live their life.').</li>
						<li>At the end of the Genocide/No Mercy route (henceforth simply 'No Mercy route'), Chara speaks to us in the second person. ('It was you who pushed everything to its edge.').</li>
						<li>Chara then asserts that they are in control in some way ("SINCE WHEN WERE YOU THE ONE IN CONTROL?").</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
					The first thing to note about these is that Frisk is evidently not simply 'us'. The True Pacifist route makes this fairly clear: Frisk is their own person, who we simply control.
				</p>
				<p>
					From there, ignoring points #4 and #5, it seems reasonable to think that we are therefore meant to embody Chara:<br>
					The player 'is' Chara, who then controls Frisk. Note that this is effectively Real World Non-diegesis, albeit with a protagonist that is analogous to an actual player.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a slightly bizarre arrangement, sure, but it very naturally explains Chara's name appearing throughout the game, and why Flowey outright calls us 'Chara'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Point #4 complicates things, however. After all, Chara speaks of themself in the first person, while addressing us in the second person.
				</p>
				<p>
					This then implies that the player is diegetic to <i>Undertale</i>. Either we diegetically control Frisk, and Chara's along for the ride, or we diegetically control Chara, who then controls Frisk.
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, the way I see it, we have two major questions right now:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Is the player diegetic (i.e. does <i>Undertale</i> subscribe to Real World Diegesis or Non-diegesis)?</li>
						<li>Does the player control, whether diegetically or not, Frisk or Chara?</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
					From here, there's four possibilites:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The player is diegetic and controls Frisk.</li>
						<li>The player is diegetic and controls Chara, who then controls Frisk.</li>
						<li>The player is non-diegetic and controls Frisk.</li>
						<li>The player is non-diegetic and controls Chara, who then controls Frisk.</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
					Now, let's dissect each of these options, and consider what they entail.
				</p>

			<h2><i>Undertale</i> 's Possible Scenarios</h2>
			
				<h3>Diegetic Player Controlling Frisk</h3>
					<p>
						This possibility is a pretty natural way to have the player control Frisk without 'being' them or Chara.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, this scenario assumes that:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Flowey is simply wrong in his assumption that Chara is in control at the end of True Pacifist.</li>
							<li>Chara's name on the SAVE File and in battle simply comes from their presence, as opposed to their control.</li>
							<li>Chara's "SINCE WHEN WERE YOU THE ONE IN CONTROL?" spiel does not actually mean that they're  in control of Frisk; only that they have some amount of power.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				
				<h3>Diegetic Player Controlling Chara</h3>
					<p>
						This scenario implies that the player controls Chara, who then controls Frisk.
					</p>
					<p>
						This adequately addresses Frisk and Chara as separate entities from the player, Flowey's dialogue, and Chara's name appearing on the SAVE File and in battle.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, this scenario is bizarrely complicated; it introduces a lot of narrative complexity for seemingly no reason, aside to account for various independant details.
						<br>
						That is to say, this feels less like a cohesive narrative idea and more like a band-aid covering up a plot contrivance.
					</p>
					<p>
						This makes this scenario less desirable, but not impossible, especially given other <i>Undertale</i> plot contrivances (see: essence lore).
					</p>
				
				<h3>Non-diegetic Player Controlling Frisk</h3>
					<p>
						This scenario assumes that the player is non-diegetic to the world of <i>Undertale</i>, and is simply meant to 'be' Frisk.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is by far the simplest possibility, and is arguably what the player is supposed to assume for the majority of the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, in my opinion, this scenario is the most flawed of the bunch, and by far.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the concessions of a diegetic player controlling Frisk, this scenario also assumes that the True Pacifist route's insistence that Frisk is their own person is either a one-time fourth wall break, or simply wrong somehow.
					</p>
				
				<h3>Non-diegetic Player Controlling Chara</h3>
					<p>
						This scenario implies that the player is meant to 'be' Chara.
					</p>
					<p>
						This very naturally explains their name's presence on the SAVE File and in battle, in addition to being corroborated by Flowey's post-pacifist speech, and accomodating for Frisk's individuality.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, it largely ignores Chara's No Mercy monologue.
					</p>
					<p>
						For this scenario to work, you have to either assume that it's a one-time fourth wall break, or that Chara is speaking to Frisk, and that the player has simply switched perspectives for some reason.
					</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					So, which of these are the most likely?
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, in my opinion, I'm highly averse to the latter two, those being the non-diegetic player scenarios.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the case that we non-diegetically control Frisk, it ignores the blatent implications of their autonomy, and in the case that we non-diegetically control Chara, it ignores their No Mercy monologue.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is opposed to the former two scenarios, which are either simply complicated (as in the case of the player diegetically controlling Chara) or simply go against certain vague implications (as in the case of the player diegetically controlling Frisk).
				</p>
				<p>
					Of these two, I'm inclined to lean more towards the player diegetically controlling Chara; it maintains the implications of their control (namely in regards to the SAVE File and battle screen), while its major flaw (bizarre complexity) is hardly new to <i>Undertale</i>.
