			<h2>Preface</h2>
				<p>
					<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> has quite the storied history - originally composed by Toby Fox for <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/story"><i>Homestuck,</i></a> it went unused despite numerous renditions and iterations (and leaks therof).
				</p>
				<p>
					Its motifs went on to be heard throughout <i>Homestuck</i> 's soundtrack, including (but not limited to) <i>Savior of the Waking World</i> and <i>Umbral Ultimatum</i> by Toby Fox, <i>Renewed Return</i> by Marcy Nabors, and <i>Dogfight</i> by various artists.
					<br>
					(Source: <a href="https://hsmusic.wiki/track/penumbra-phantasm/">Penumbra Phantasm | HSMusic Wiki</a>)
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, with the release of <i>Deltarune Chapters 1 and 2</i>, some have noticed that the song's influence may not have ended with <i>Homestuck</i> - indeed, <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> appears to have been referenced not only in <i>Deltarune</i>, but all the way back in <i>Undertale</i>, as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you haven't heard it before (or haven't heard it in a while), I recommend listening to and getting acquainted with it:

			<h2>Defining The Motifs</h2>
				<p>
					First, let's pick out the relevant portions of the song, and figure out what makes them identifiable.
				</p>
				
				<h3>The Opening Melody</h3>
					<p>
						This is the melody the song starts with, first in 3/4 time:
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_opening_1.png" width="800px">
					<p>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/penumbra-phantasm/other-penumbra-phantasm_opening_1.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						And then in 4/4 time:
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_opening_2.png" width="800px">
					<p>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/penumbra-phantasm/other-penumbra-phantasm_opening_2.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						Seeing how simple this motif is, to be confident in any quote, I'd need the exact intervals:
						<br>
						[-1 +3 -3 +0 +1, repeat]
					</p>
					<p>
						The 4/4 variation's rhythm is notable too of course, with its noticeable syncopation, but in my opinion, Toby Fox doesn't tend to pay too much mind to rhythm when quoting leitmotifs, so I don't think it's necessary for prospective quotes to have the exact same rhythm.
					</p>
			
				<h3>The Main Melody</h3>
					<p>
						(The first part of it, at least)
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_main_1.png" width="800px">
					<p>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/penumbra-phantasm/other-penumbra-phantasm_main.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						Now <em animSubType="wave">this</em> is a leitmotif!
					</p>
					<p>
						It's based off of this motif:
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_main_2.png" width="400px">
					<p>
						[-1 +1 +2 -3 -4 -3]
					</p>
					<p>
						It's repeated verbatim in the third measure, and in the second with a modification:
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_main_3.png" width="400px">
					<p>
						[-1 +1 +2 -3 -4 +12 -5 +2]
					</p>
					<p>
						For this part of <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i>, I think the most relevant parts are...
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The melody starts on an off-beat.</li>
						<li>The [-1 +1] intervals of the opening few notes.</li>
						<li>The [-3 -4 -3] intervals of the downwards motion.</li>
						<li>The second phrase is modified, with a contour of [big leap -> normal descent -> small leap].</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>The Opening Melody in <i>Hopes and Dreams</i></h2>
				<p>
					Take a listen to timestamps 1:18-1:29 of <i>Hopes and Dreams</i>, where the <a href="../motifs/your-best-friend.html">'Your Best Friend'</a> motif is introduced:
				</p>
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/penumbra-phantasm/ut-087_opening_1.mp3" controls></audio>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, let's take only the right-ear channel of <i>Hopes and Dreams</i> :
				</p>
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/penumbra-phantasm/ut-087_opening_2.mp3" controls></audio>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now let's apply a high-pass filter to focus only on melodies above 500hz (amplified so it isn't made quieter):
				</p>
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/penumbra-phantasm/ut-087_opening_3.mp3" controls></audio>
				</p>
				<p>
					And a low-pass filter to focus only on melodies below 550hz (again, amplified):
				</p>
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/penumbra-phantasm/ut-087_opening_4.mp3" controls></audio>
				</p>
				<p>
					Does that piano melody sound at all familiar?
					<br>
					Well, how about we look at a transcription:
				</p>
				<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_hopes-and-dreams.png" width="800px">
				<p>
					<b animSubType="rainbow">Yo, dawg, I think I just saw a leitmotif!</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Yep, you saw/heard that correctly, this is a perfect quote of <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> 's 4/4 intro:
				</p>
				<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_opening_2.png" width="800px">
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/penumbra-phantasm/other-penumbra-phantasm_opening_2.mp3" controls></audio>
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that 1:36-1:46 of <i>SAVE the World</i> repeats this segment verbatim, albeit slightly faster and higher-pitched:
				</p>
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/penumbra-phantasm/ut-089_opening.mp3" controls></audio>
				</p>
				<p>
					In any case, although the quote is perfect, the question remains: is it intentional?
				</p>
				<p>
					In my opinion, yes.
				</p>
				<p>
					These exact intervals with this exact rythm makes for too strong of a coincidence to ignore.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, consider that Toby Fox had been tweaking <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> for years at this point, even going so far as to prank the <i>Homestuck</i> fanbase by dealing out fake 'leaks' of it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given this, it's difficult for me to argue that Toby composed this melody without noticing the striking resemblance.

			<h2>The (first part of the) Main Melody as 'THE HOLY B'</h2>
				<p>
					Now, let's take a listen to the <a href="../motifs/the-holy.html">'THE HOLY B'</a> motif as heard in <i>THE HOLY</i> :
				</p>
				<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_the-holy_1.png" width="800px">
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/penumbra-phantasm/ch1-35_main.mp3" controls></audio>
				</p>
				<p>
					And here's the main motif of <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i>, for reference:
				</p>
				<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_main_1.png" width="800px">
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/penumbra-phantasm/other-penumbra-phantasm_main.mp3" controls></audio>
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's revisit the four identifying features of <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> 's main motif:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The melody starts on an off-beat.</li>
					<li>The [-1 +1] intervals of the opening few notes.</li>
					<li>The [-3 -4 -3] intervals of the downwards motion.</li>
					<li>The second phrase is modified, with a contour of [big leap -> normal descent -> small leap].</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					First off, just like <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i>, 'THE HOLY B' starts on an off-beat.
				</p>
				<p>
					Points 2 and 3 don't look so good at first glance, however:
				</p>
				<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_main_2.png" width="400px">
				<p>
					(<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> )
				</p>
				<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_the-holy_2.png" width="400px">
				<p>
					('THE HOLY B')
				</p>
				<p>
					'THE HOLY B' is missing the [+1] and first [-3] intervals, in addition to a [+2] interval.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, I think it's worth noting what happens when you remove the D, E, and C# notes from <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> :
				</p>
				<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_main_4.png" width="400px">
				<p>
					You get the same intervals as in 'THE HOLY B'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now of course, you can modify any motif to be any other motif, but I do think it's worth noting that 'THE HOLY B' may very well be a simplification of <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for point 4, 'THE HOLY B' is indeed modified in its second phrase, in a way similar to <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i>:
				</p>
				<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_main_3.png" width="400px">
				<p>
					(<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> )
				</p>
				<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_the-holy_3.png" width="400px">
				<p>
					('THE HOLY B')
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact, aside from intervals, the contour is identical, minus the extra F and E (which mind you, are repeats of the first two notes of the phrase).
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, it's worth noting that where <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> has a third and fourth measure that further expands on the motif, 'THE HOLY B' does not have this.
				</p>
				<p>
					Personally, I don't think it's too big of a deal, but it is worth mentioning.
				</p>
				<p>
					Okay, so is this resemblance intentional?
				</p>
				<p>
					Personally, I'm split:
					<br>
					There's more than enough similarities for this to be notable, but at the same time they're different enough for this to be doubtable.
				</p>
				<p>
					As unfortunate as it is for me to say this, I think we'll just have to wait for Chapters 3 and 4 to see where the 'THE HOLY B' motif ends up next.
				</p>
				<p>
					After all, <i>THE HOLY</i> is the only definitive quote we have of it; it's possible future renditions will resemble <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> more closely (or not).
