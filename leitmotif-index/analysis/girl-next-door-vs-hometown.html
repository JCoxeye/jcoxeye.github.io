			<h2>Preface</h2>
				<p>
					<a href="../motifs/girl-next-door.html">'Girl Next Door'</a> and <a href="../motifs/hometown.html">'Hometown'</a> are two relatively important leitmotifs in the <i>Deltarune</i> soundtrack.
				</p>
				<p>
					'Girl Next Door' is the theme of Noelle, a very prominent character, and 'Hometown' is the theme of Hometown, the setting of the game.
				</p>

				</p>
				<p>
					The leitmotifs themselves are fairly distinct, but 'Girl Next Door' is often capped off with a particular melody:

					<br>
					('Girl Next Door (Extra)' as heard in <i>Ferris Wheel</i>)
				</p>
				<p>
					Which bears a striking similarity to the melody <i>Hometown</i> and its derivatives use to cap off phrases of <a href="../motifs/hopes-and-dreams.html">'Hopes and Dreams'</a>:

					('Hometown (Extra 2)' as heard in <i>A Town Called Hometown</i>)
				</p>

					This article aims to disambiguate these two motifs, analyzing them and providing a reasoning as to their separation in this index.

			<h2>Analysis</h2>
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/girl-next-door/ch2-31_extra.mp3" controls></audio>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/hometown/ch1-37_extra-2.mp3" controls></audio>

					('Girl Next Door (Extra)' as heard in <i>Ferris Wheel</i>, and 'Hometown (Extra 2)' as heard in <i>A Town Called Hometown</i>)

				<p>
					('Girl Next Door (Extra)': dark blue, above; F# Minor)
					<br>
					('Hometown (Extra 2)': light blue, below; C Major)
				</p>
				<p>
					As you can see, both feature a leadup to a pretty distinct descent, followed by a leap back up, that either repeats a note or modulates down and then back up a semitone.
				</p>
				<p>
					The leadups are different, yes, but not all examples of these motifs even have said leadups, so I feel comfortable dismissing that as a somewhat irrelevant difference.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, where 'Girl Next Door (Extra)' repeats the 4th scale degree (B) at its end, while 'Hometown (Extra 2)' modulates down and back up a semitone (C-B-C).
					<br>
					Again, though, I think this is an irrelevant difference, as they both still emphasize the note the end up landing on.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, there are a couple more notable differences:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						In 'Girl Next Door (Extra)', the descent is from the 6th (D) down to the 3rd (A), whereas 'Hometown (Extra 2)'s descent is from the 4th (F) to the tonic (C), plus an extra [-5] interval leading down to the 5th (G) of the octave below.
					</li>
					<li>
						The upwards leap of 'Girl Next Door (Extra)' goes up to the 4th (B), whereas 'Hometown (Extra 2)' simply goes back to the tonic (C) from the aforementioned 5th.
						<br>
						This has the effect of having 'Girl Next Door (Extra)' end on (relatively) unstable note, whereas 'Hometown (Extra 2)' lands back on the stable tonic.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					These two factors make the end result sound fairly different, even if the descents (D-C#-A / F-E-C) are intervallically identical.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, I note how quotes of the two motifs do not overlap:
				</p>
				<p>
					There is, as far as I'm aware, not a single instance of the motifs appearing together in the same song, nor of 'Girl Next Door (Extra)' capping off any other motifs in quite the same way 'Hometown (Extra 2)' does.
				</p>
				<p>
					This, to me, implies that these motifs are indeed different motifs, even if incidentally similar due to the use of the same couple of intervals.
