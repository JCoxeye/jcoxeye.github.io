			<h2>Preface</h2>
				<p>
					Prior to <i>Undertale</i> 's release, Toby Fox worked on a variety of projects, ranging from one-off compositions, to fan works of other media, to contributing to the <i>Homestuck Original Soundtrack</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interestingly, some of Toby Fox's prior compositions are either highly reminiscent of or nearly identical to some motifs used in <i>Undertale</i> and <i>Deltarune</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, some songs and motifs in <i>Undertale</i> and <i>Deltarune</i> are evidently inspired by others' work.
				</p>
				<p>
					This article will cover a variety of examples of this, ranging from simple inspiration, to the re-use of particular motifs.
				</p>

			<h2>Reuse of Prior Songs</h2>
				<p>
					Certain songs in <i>Undertale</i> and <i>Deltarune</i> were initially made for prior projects, only to be repurposed.
				</p>
				
				<h3><i>Fallen Down</i></h3>
					<p>
						From the <i>Undertale</i> sheet music booklet:
						<br>
						"Ironically, this is one of many songs in this booklet not to be originally composed for Undertale."
						<br>
						"I actually created this for a fan-album called "I Miss You" as an attempt at creating an original "Game Over" theme."
					</p>
					<p>
						Indeed, <i>Fallen Down</i>, the theme of Toriel, was orginally composed for the 2012 <i>Earthbound</i> tribute album <a href="https://sleepytimejesse.bandcamp.com/album/i-miss-you-earthbound-2012"><i>I Miss You,</i></a> as <a href="https://sleepytimejesse.bandcamp.com/track/fallen-down">Fallen Down</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						(See also: <a href="../motifs/fallen-down.html">'Fallen Down'</a>)
					</p>
				
				<h3><i>Nyeh Heh Heh!</i>, <i>Bonetrousle</i>, <i>sans.</i>, and <i>Heartache</i></h3>
					<p>
						Also from the <i>Undertale</i> sheet music booklet, under <i>Nyeh Heh Heh!</i> :
						<br>
						"This song wasn't made for Undertale either."
						<br>
						"It (and Bonestrousle) were the main battle themes of an RPG game I was working on before Undertale, based off of a dream I had."
						<br>
						"However, I didn't plan it very well, so the project fell apart before I accomplished a single room."
						<br>
						" "Sans" was also a song in the game called "Muscles," and "Heartache" was a song called "Joker Battle." "
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're familiar with the origins of <i>Deltarune</i>, this anecdote may ring a bell.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, all that's relevant here is that these four were originally created prior to <i>Undertale</i>, and were simply repurposed for the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						(See also: <a href="../motifs/nyeh-heh-heh.html">'Nyeh Heh Heh!',</a> <a href="../motifs/sans.html">'sans.',</a> and <a href="../motifs/heartache.html">'Heartache'</a>)

			<h2>Reuse of Prior Motifs</h2>
				<p>
					Sometimes, as opposed to the reuse of a full song, Toby Fox instead references only a part of a previous track.
				</p>
				
				<h3><i>Patient</i></h3>
					<p>
						<i>Patient</i>, composed by Toby Fox, is a remix of <a href="https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/doctor-3"><i>Doctor,</i></a> the background music for the <a href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Land_of_Wind_and_Shade">Land of Wind and Shade</a> from <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/story"><i>Homestuck</i></a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are a few things of note about this:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The Land of Wind and Shade strongly resembles Waterfall, with its blue, rocky design.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Land of Wind and Shade is a planet in the <a href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Medium">Medium,</a> from which the song <i>Another Medium</i> evidently dervies its name.
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Patient</i> Appears to be the origin of the 'Another Medium' leitmotif itself:
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/another-medium/ut-031_another-medium.mp3" controls></audio>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/another-medium/ut-051_another-medium.mp3" controls></audio>
						<br>
						('Another Medium', as heard in <i>Waterfall</i> and <i>Another Medium</i>, respectively)
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Patient</i> : 0:29-0:59
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/another-medium/other-patient_another-medium.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						Of course, that's not the only similarity: both <i>Another Medium</i> and <i>Patient</i> use the exact same instrumenetation, including the same drum samples used in <i>Cave Story</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						(See also: <a href="../motifs/another-medium.html">'Another Medium'</a>)
					</p>
				
				<h3><i>Cucumber Quest</i></h3>
					<p>
						<a href="https://cucumber.gigidigi.com/"><i>Cucumber Quest,</i></a> written by Gigi D.G., is a web comic 'about bunny kids going on adventures', and is (as of writing) on <a href="https://cucumber.gigidigi.com/cq/important-announcement/">indefinite hiatus</a>.
						<br>
						Gigi D.G. is also credited for various pieces of concept art for <i>Deltarune</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Importantly, Toby Fox composed two fan-made songs for the characters <a href="https://cucumber.gigidigi.com/cq/page-346/">Noisemaster</a> and <a href="https://cucumber.gigidigi.com/cq/page-120/">Nightmare Knight,</a> which appear to be the origins of two motifs:
					</p>
					<h4>'Metal Crusher'</h4>
						<p>
							<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/metal-crusher/ut-050_main.mp3" controls></audio>
							<br>
							('Metal Crusher', as heard in <i>Metal Crusher</i>)
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Noisemaster</i></a> : 0:35-0:52, 1:28-1:44
							<br>
							<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/metal-crusher/other-noisemaster_main.mp3" controls></audio>
						</p>
					<h4>'The Door'</h4>
						<p>
							<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-door/ch1-07.mp3" controls></audio>
							<br>
							('The Door', as heard in <i>The Chase</i>)
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Nightmare Knight</i> : 0:48-1:11
							<br>
							<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-door/other-nightmare-knight_1.mp3" controls></audio>
						</p>
						<p>
							Later on in the song, the melody is played in double-time, and slightly remixed:
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Nightmare Knight</i> : 1:30-1:53
							<br>
							<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-door/other-nightmare-knight_2.mp3" controls></audio>
						</p>
						<p>

				<h3><i>Penumbra Phantasm</i></h3>
					<p>
						<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> has quite the storied history - originally composed by Toby Fox for <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/story"><i>Homestuck,</i></a> it went unused despite numerous renditions and iterations (and leaks therof).
					</p>
					<p>
						Eventually however, it appears that part of its melody was re-fitted for use in <i>Deltarune</i> as 'THE HOLY B'; take a listen:
					</p>
					<p>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch1-35_b.mp3" controls></audio>
						<br>
						('THE HOLY B', as heard in <i>THE HOLY</i> )
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> : 1:06-1:31
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/other-penumbra-phantasm_b_1.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						Later in the song, the melody appears in a slightly different form with a noticeably different ending:
					<p>
						<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> : 1:54-2:18
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/other-penumbra-phantasm_b_2.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						Notably, <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> also contains the 'Doctor' leitmotif used throughout <i>Homestuck</i>.
						<br>
						The leitmotif eventually found its way into <i>Patient</i>, another track Toby Fox composed, and the apparent origin of the 'Another Medium' leitmotif, as discussed above.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyway, although the similarity may have already jumped out to you, I still think it's worth dissecting the two melodies:
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/the-holy_the-holy-b.png">
					<p>
						('THE HOLY B', as heard in <i>THE HOLY</i> )
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_the-holy-b.png">
					<p>
						('THE HOLY B', as heard in <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i>)
					</p>
					<p>
						'THE HOLY B' has intervals of:
						<br>
						[-1 -4 -3]
						<br>
						[+8 -1 +3]
						<br>
						[-2]
						<br>
						[-1 -4 -3]
						<br>
						[+8 -1 +8]
						<br>
						[-8 +1]
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> 's quote has intervals of:
						<br>
						[-1 +1 +2 -3 -4 -3]
						<br>
						[+8 -1 +1 +2 -3 +1 +7]
						<br>
						[-5 +2]
					</p>
					<p>
						Obviously <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> 's quote is more complex, but it tells a similar story:
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> 's [-1 +1 +2 -3 -4 -3] intervals work as a more complicated form of 'THE HOLY B's [-1 -4 -3] intervals.
						<br>
						The former has extra [+1 +2 -3] intervals, but they still land on the same note they began on (C#-D-E-C#), meaning the [-1 -4 -3] intervals are largely kept intact.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> then pulls the same trick, turning 'THE HOLY B's [+8 -1 +8] intervals into intervals of [+8 -1 +1 +2 -3 +1 +7].
						<br>
						After jumping back to the starting note ([+8] after [-1 -4 -3]), <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> once again complicates a [-1] interval into [-1 +1 +2 -3], before slicing a [+8] interval into a set of [+1 +7] intervals.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, both melodies end on a harsh fall followed by a short jump:
						<br>
						[-8 +1] in 'THE HOLY B', and
						<br>
						[-5 +2] in <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall, the melodies are very similar, especially considering the perfectly maintained sequence of [-4 -3 +8 -1] in both.
					</p>
					<p>
						Of course, the melody is much more complicated and the ending is noticeably different than 'THE HOLY B's, but the overall sound of the melody is preserved. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Further, I argue it'd make sense for the melodies to be different in this way: the melody has been adapted for a significantly different song in wholly different project, so it makes sense that they'd have some differences, even in expressing the same motif.
					</p>

					</p>
				
				<h3><i>treasure_discovered.mp3</i></h3>
					<p>
						A bit of an odd case, <i>treasure_discovered.mp3</i> is a short track uploaded to Toby Fox's website, which features a backing melody later reused for <i>THE HOLY</i>:
					</p>
					<p>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch1-35_backing.mp3" controls></audio>
						<br>
						('THE HOLY (BACKING)', as heard in <i>THE HOLY</i> )
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>treasure_discovered.mp3</i> : 0:00-0:41
						<br>
