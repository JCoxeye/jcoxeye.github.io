			<h2>Preface</h2>
				<p>
					Prior to <i>Undertale</i> 's release, Toby Fox worked on a variety of projects, ranging from one-off compositions, to fan works of other media, to contributing to the <i>Homestuck Original Soundtrack</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interestingly, some of Toby Fox's prior compositions are either highly reminiscent of or nearly identical to some motifs used in <i>Undertale</i> and <i>Deltarune</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, some songs and motifs in <i>Undertale</i> and <i>Deltarune</i> are evidently inspired by others' work.
				</p>
				<p>
					This article will cover a variety of examples of this, ranging from simple inspiration, to the re-use of particular motifs.

			<h2>Reuse of Prior Songs</h2>
				<p>
					Certain songs in <i>Undertale</i> and <i>Deltarune</i> were initially made for prior projects, only to be repurposed.
				</p>
				
				<h3><i>Fallen Down</i></h3>
					<p>
						From the <i>Undertale</i> sheet music booklet:
						<br>
						"Ironically, this is one of many songs in this booklet not to be originally composed for Undertale."
						<br>
						"I actually created this for a fan-album called "I Miss You" as an attempt at creating an original "Game Over" theme."
					</p>
					<p>
						Indeed, <i>Fallen Down</i>, the theme of Toriel, was orginally composed for the 2012 <i>Earthbound</i> tribute album <a href="https://sleepytimejesse.bandcamp.com/album/i-miss-you-earthbound-2012"><i>I Miss You</i></a> , as <a href="https://sleepytimejesse.bandcamp.com/track/fallen-down">Fallen Down</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						(See also: <a href="../motifs/fallen-down.html">'Fallen Down'</a>)
					</p>
				
				<h3><i>Nyeh Heh Heh!</i>, <i>Bonetrousle</i>, <i>sans.</i>, and <i>Heartache</i></h3>
					<p>
						Also from the <i>Undertale</i> sheet music booklet, under <i>Nyeh Heh Heh!</i> :
						<br>
						"This song wasn't made for Undertale either."
						<br>
						"It (and Bonestrousle) were the main battle themes of an RPG game I was working on before Undertale, based off of a dream I had."
						<br>
						"However, I didn't plan it very well, so the project fell apart before I accomplished a single room."
						<br>
						" "Sans" was also a song in the game called "Muscles," and "Heartache" was a song called "Joker Battle." "
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're familiar with the origins of <i>Deltarune</i>, this anecdote may ring a bell.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, all that's relevant here is that these four were originally created prior to <i>Undertale</i>, and were simply repurposed for the game.
					</p>
