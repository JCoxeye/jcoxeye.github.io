					('It's Showtime!', as heard in <i>It's Showtime!</i>)
				</p>
				<p>
					'It's Showtime!', alongside <a href="metal-crusher.html">'Metal Crusher',</a> <a href="hotel.html">'Hotel',</a> and <a href="oh.html">'Oh!',</a> serve as Mettaton's leitmotifs, appearing in various contexts relating to the character.
					<br>
					(Mind you, it's highly recommended to read these articles together!)
				</p>
				<p>
					'It's Showtime!' serves as Mettaton's main motif, appearing in most of his themes.

							<p>
								(Above: 'It's Showtime!'; below: <i>Metal Crusher</i>, 0:04-0:12)
							</p>
							<p>
								They may look very different at first glance, but looking closer, similarities can be seen.
							</p>
							<p>
								Let's split up the melodies into distinct chunks:
							</p>
							<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/its-showtime_metal-crusher_2.png" width="800px">
							<p>
								Section 1 of 'It's Showtime!' and <i>Metal Crusher</i> are near identical. The only difference is that instead of starting with a [-2] interval, <i>Metal Crusher</i> starts with [+1 -1] intervals.
							</p>
							<p>
								Importantly, both use a particular pattern:
							</p>
							<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/its-showtime_metal-crusher_3.png" width="100px">
							<p>
								This pattern (henceforth the 'staple' pattern) is repeated very often in both melodies, and is the most identifiable part of the motif for our purposes - try to find all of the places it appears in the full example above.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sections 2 and 6 of both serve to bridge the surrounding sections together with a descending motion. Although they're are not too much alike, it is worth noting how the last 3 notes of section 2 in <i>Metal Crusher</i> is a repeat of the 'staple' pattern.
							</p>
							<p>
								Looking at sections 3 and 7, <i>Metal Crusher</i> replaces the melody of 'It's Showtime!' with a semitone modulation. That is to say that they're really nothing alike, outside of being the lowest point of the melody. You <em>could</em> argue that the semitone modulation is a variation of the 'staple' pattern, but this is a dubious point to me.
							</p>
							<p>
								Section 4 of both melodies are near identical. The only differences are that 'It's Showtime!' has a different start, and that it's 'staple' pattern has different intervals.
							</p>
							<p>
								Section 5 of <i>Metal Crusher</i> is largely different than section 5 of 'It's Showtime!', albeit with a vaguely similar rhythm.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, section 8 of <i>Metal Crusher</i>, like section 4, is a near exact quote of 'It's Showtime!'. The only differences are that the start is changed in the same way, and that the last two notes are simplified into one.
							</p>
							<p>
								Let's recap.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Section 1 is a near perfect quote.</li>
								<li>Section 2 is mostly different, but quotes the 'staple' pattern of 'It's Showtime!'.</li>
								<li>Section 3 is completely different.</li>
								<li>Section 4 is a near perfect quote.</li>
								<li>Section 5 is mostly different.</li>
								<li>Section 6 is mostly different.</li>
								<li>Section 7 is completely different.</li>
								<li>Section 8 is a near perfect quote.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Including section 2, only half of <i>Metal Crusher</i> 's supposed quote is close to 'It's Showtime!'.
							</p>
							<p>
								You might say that this makes this quote bunk, but I disagree.
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>Metal Crusher</i> quotes 'It's Showtime!' perfectly too often for me to dismiss as mere coincidence.
							</p>
							<p>
								Yes, it's different in a lot of places, but as the 'It's Showtime!' motif is fairly long, it has room to be modified while keeping enough intact for it to be recognizable.
							</p>
							<p>
								In my opinion, it's highly likely that <i>Metal Crusher</i> was made with 'It's Showtime!' in mind, keeping the most recognizable parts of the motif, and modifying the rest, in order to give a wholly new feel to the same leitmotif.
