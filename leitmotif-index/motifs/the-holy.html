			<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>
					'THE HOLY' is a seemingly very important motif, heard in only a few minor (but very important) songs, namely <i>THE HOLY</i> and <i>flashback_excerpt.ogg</i>.
					<br>
					The motif itself is split into two distinct halves:
				</p>
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch1-35_a.mp3" controls></audio>
					<br>
					('THE HOLY A', as heard in <i>THE HOLY</i>)
				</p>
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch1-35_b.mp3" controls></audio>
					<br>
					('THE HOLY B', as heard in <i>THE HOLY</i>)
				</p>
				<p>
					Together:
					<br>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch1-35_a_b.mp3" controls></audio>
					<br>
					('THE HOLY', as heard in <i>THE HOLY</i>)
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, the motif has a backing melody:
				</p>
				<p>
					<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch1-35_backing.mp3" controls></audio>
					<br>
					('THE HOLY (BACKING)', as heard in <i>THE HOLY</i>)
				</p>
				<p>
					Worth noting is that, like '<a href="another-medium.html">Another Medium</a>', '<a href="metal-crusher.html">Metal Crusher</a>', and '<a href="the-door.html">The Door</a>', 'THE HOLY' seemingly originates from a song <i>Unrelated</i> to <i>Undertale</i> and <i>Deltarune</i> - <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> (as covered below).

			<h2>Appearances</h2>
				
				<h3 id="ch1-35"><i>THE HOLY</i></h3>
					<p>
						'THE HOLY (BACKING)': 0:00-0:06
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch1-35_backing.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						'THE HOLY (+ BACKING)': 0:06-0:47
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch1-35_a_b.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
				
				<h3 id="ch1-40"><i>Before the Story</i></h3>
					<p>
						'THE HOLY (BACKING)': 0:59-1:24
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch1-40_backing.mp3" controls></audio>
						<br>
						(In the flute fading in and out, panned right)
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether or not this quote is intentional is debatable, but I'm inclined to think it is, given the similar modulation and repeated crescendo of the motif.
					</p>
					<p>
						(See also: '<a href="once-upon-a-time.html">Once Upon a Time</a>')
					</p>
				
				<h3 id="ch2-01"><i>Faint Glow</i></h3>
					<p>
						In <i>Faint Glow</i>, '<a href="dont-forget.html">Don't Forget A</a>' appears with alongside a particular melody.
					</p>
					<p>
						This melody is similar to both 'THE HOLY A' (in terms of rhythm) and 'THE HOLY B' (in terms of the descending structure), and even has a backing with a similar crescendo and the exact same sleigh bells from <i>THE HOLY</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The only problem?
					</p>
					<p>
						It's not 'THE HOLY'.
						<br>
						Melodically, at least.
					</p>
					<p>
						The descent is similar to 'THE HOLY B' and there's no doubt the song is meant to be reminiscent of <i>THE HOLY</i>, but the melody itself is fairly different:
					</p>
					<p>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch2-01_b.mp3" controls></audio>
						<br>
						(A snippet of <i>Faint Glow</i>, 0:00-0:51)
					</p>
					<p>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch1-35_b.mp3" controls></audio>
						<br>
						('THE HOLY B', as heard in <i>THE HOLY</i>)
					</p>
					<p>
						Regardless, whether or not they're melodically the same is actually somewhat irrelevant; this index focuses on melodic leitmotifs, but motifs can also be intruments and other patterns.
					</p>
					<p>
						In that way, although <i>Faint Glow</i> does not truly contain 'THE HOLY', it certainly does reference <i>THE HOLY</i>, if that makes sense.
					</p>
				
				<h3 id="ch2-flashback-excerpt"><i>flashback_excerpt.ogg</i></h3>
					<p>
						'THE HOLY A': 0:16-0:31
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch2-flashback-excerpt_a.mp3" controls></audio>
						<br>
						(In the radio-telephone-esque trumpet-ey synth in the back)
					</p>
				
				<h3 id="ut-092"><i>Reunited</i></h3>
					<p>
						Since this article is already covers a few edge cases, let's go all out with <i>Undertale</i>'s <i>Reunited</i>:
					</p>
					<p>
						'THE HOLY A': 2:42-3:56
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ut-092_a.mp3" controls></audio>
						<br>
						(In the strings in the back)
					</p>
					<p>
						A transcription reveals intervals of:
						<br>
						[-2 +5 -5 +2] for <i>Reunited</i>,
						<br>
						[-5 +2 -5 +10] for <i>THE HOLY</i>, and
						<br>
						[-2 +2 -5 +10] for <i>flashback_excerpt.ogg</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although it may seem like an interesting connection at first glance, I think this quote isn't all too likely to be intentional.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of the intervals are there, but the key [-5 to +10] ending isn't, and there's little else in support of the argument.
					</p>
					<p>
						Given that, this quote simply isn't strong enough to carry the weight of " 'THE HOLY A' originates from <i>Undertale</i> " on its shoulders.
					</p>
				
				<h3 id="other-penumbra-phantasm"><i>Penumbra Phantasm</i></h3>
					<p>
						<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> has quite the storied history - originally composed by Toby Fox for <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/story"><i>Homestuck</i></a>, it went unused despite numerous renditions and iterations (and leaks therof).
					</p>
					<p>
						Eventually however, it appears that part of its melody was re-fitted for use in <i>Deltarune</i> as 'THE HOLY B'; take a listen:
					</p>
					<p>
						'THE HOLY B': 1:06-1:31
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/other-penumbra-phantasm_b_1.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						'THE HOLY B' as heard in <i>THE HOLY</i>, for reference:
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/ch1-35_b.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						Later in the song, the melody appears in a slightly different form with a noticeably different ending:
					<p>
						'THE HOLY B': 1:54-2:18
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/the-holy/other-penumbra-phantasm_b_2.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						Notably, <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> also contains the 'Doctor' leitmotif used throughout <i>Homestuck</i>.
						<br>
						The leitmotif eventually found its way into <i>Patient</i>, another track Toby Fox composed, and the apparent origin of the '<a href="another-medium.html">Another Medium</a>' leitmotif.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also worth mentioning are <i>Noisemaster</i> and <i>Nightmare Knight</i> - they were composed by Toby Fox as fan-made character themes for the web comic <a href="https://cucumber.gigidigi.com/"><i>Cucumber Quest</i></a>, by Gigi D.G., serving as the origins of the '<a href="metal-crusher.html">Metal Crusher</a>' and '<a href="the-door.html">The Door</a>' leitmotifs.
					</p>
					<p>
						Oh wait, I didn't talk about the quote itself at all.
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/the-holy_the-holy-b.png">
					<p>
						('THE HOLY B', as heard in <i>THE HOLY</i>)
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/penumbra-phantasm_the-holy-b.png">
					<p>
						('THE HOLY B', as heard in <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i>)
					</p>
					<p>
						'THE HOLY B' has intervals of:
						<br>
						[-1 -4 -3]
						<br>
						[+8 -1 +3]
						<br>
						[-2]
						<br>
						[-1 -4 -3]
						<br>
						[+8 -1 +8]
						<br>
						[-8 +1]
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> 's quote has intervals of:
						<br>
						[-1 +1 +2 -3 -4 -3]
						<br>
						[+8 -1 +1 +2 -3 +1 +7]
						<br>
						[-5 +2]
					</p>
					<p>
						Obviously <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> 's quote is more complex, but it tells a similar story:
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> 's [-1 +1 +2 -3 -4 -3] intervals work as a more complicated form of 'THE HOLY B's [-1 -4 -3] intervals.
						<br>
						The former has extra [+1 +2 -3] intervals, but they still land on the same note they began on (C#-D-E-C#), meaning the [-1 -4 -3] intervals are largely kept intact.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> then pulls the same trick, turning 'THE HOLY B's [+8 -1 +8 -8 +1] intervals into intervals of [+8 -1 +1 +2 -3 +1 +7].
						<br>
						After jumping back to the starting note ([+8] after [-1 -4 -3]), <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i> once again complicates a [-1] interval into [-1 +1 +2 -3], before slicing a [+8] interval into a set of [+1 +7] intervals.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, both melodies end on a harsh fall followed by a short jump:
						<br>
						[-8 +1] in 'THE HOLY B', and
						<br>
						[-5 +2] in <i>Penumbra Phantasm</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall, the melodies are very similar, especially considering the perfectly maintained sequence of [-4 -3 +8 -1] in both.
					</p>
					<p>
						Of course, the melody is much more complicated and the ending is noticeably different than 'THE HOLY B's, but the overall sound of the melody is preserved. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Further, I argue it'd make sense for the melodies to be different in this way: the melody has been adapted for a significantly different song in wholly different project, so it makes sense that they'd have some differences, even in expressing the same motif.
