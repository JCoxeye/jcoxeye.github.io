				</p>
				<p>
					'Your Best Nightmare' and <a href="your-best-friend.html">'Your Best Friend'</a> serve as Flowey's themes in <i>Undertale</i>.
					<br>
					In <i>Deltarune</i> however, 'Your Best Nightmare' appears to have been repurposed to represent general fear and terror, particularly in the face of an insurmountable threat.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, there exists a percussion beat (referred to here as 'Burn in Despair!'), that is re-used in a similar way for Giga Queen's <i>Giga Size</i> :

						During timestamps 1:26-1:47, when 'Your Best Nightmare' would normally play as indicated by the structure of the song, a heavily distorted version of <a href="your-best-friend.html">'Your Best Friend'</a> plays instead.

				<h3 id="ch2-33"><i>Giga Size</i></h3>
					<p>
						Before we venture into 'Your Best Nightmare' appearing in <i>Deltarune</i>, let's first look at 'Burn in Despair!' in <i>Giga Size</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						'Burn in Despair!': 0:15-1:31
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/your-best-nightmare/ch2-33_bid.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						Note how the use of 'Burn in Despair!' here parallels the phase transition in Asriel's fight.
					</p>
					<p>
						Interestingly, this isn't the only time a percussion track from <i>Undertale</i> suddenly reappears in relation to Queen: <a href="anticipation.html">'Anticipation',</a> the percussion of <i>Undertale</i> 's battle themes, reappears in both <i>Powers Combined</i> and <i>Knock You Down !!</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						(See also: <a href="queen.html">'Queen'</a>)
					</p>
				
				<h3 id="ch1-23"><i>Imminent Death</i></h3>
					<p>
						Alright, back to 'Your Best Nightmare'.
						<br>
						This and the following examples are somewhat contentious, so I'll dissect them more thoroughly; expect lots of FL studio screenshots. Note that the rhythms for all of the transcriptions here have been approximated.
					</p>
					<p>
						'Your Best Nightmare': 0:05-0:17
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/your-best-nightmare/ch1-23_ybn.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>

					<p>
						(Above: 'Your Best Nightmare' as heard in <i>Your Best Nightmare</i> ; below: the melody of <i>Imminent Death</i>)
					</p>
					<p>
						Looking at 'Your Best Nightmare', note the structure: a small descent, followed by a leap up, a return to the starting note, another small descent, and a higher leap up.
					</p>
					<p>
						To me, the most important part of this leitmotif is this descent, followed by a leap, which is then made bigger in the second repetition.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now looking at <i>Imminent Death</i>, it's exactly the same, albeit ommitting the first leap, and having a slightly smaller leap at the end.
					</p>
					<p>
						This may seem like a big deal, but note how long the first E is held - it leaves a gap, that the later E -> G progression recontextualizes as being where a step up would have been.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, the gap also emphasizes the later G as being relatively high compared to the rest of melody, reflecting how in the original melody of 'Your Best Nightmare', the C# is the highest point of the melody, and is in contrast to the C.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is to say that although it is literally different in some places, the melody is made in such a way that what it <em animSubType="wave">implies</em> is very similar to 'Your Best Nightmare'.
					</p>
				
				<h3 id="ch1-24"><i>Vs. Susie</i></h3>
					<p>
						'Your Best Nightmare': 0:06-0:53
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/your-best-nightmare/ch1-24_ybn.mp3" controls></audio>
						<br>
						(See also: <a href="susie.html">'Susie'</a>)
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/your-best-nightmare_vs-susie.png" width="800px">
					<p>
						(Above: 'Your Best Nightmare' as heard in <i>Your Best Nightmare</i> ; below: the opening melody of <i>Vs. Susie</i>)
					</p>
					<p>
						Right out of the gate, the first three notes of <i>Vs. Susie</i> 's quote are identical to not only the latter three notes of 'Your Best Nightmare', but also, crucially, to the last three notes of <i>Imminent Death</i> 's melody.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is to say, that this song serves as an extension of the melodic concept of <i>Imminent Death</i>, taking the melody of 'Your Best Nightmare' to new places. Remember that in-game, <i>Imminent Death</i> plays just before <i>Vs. Susie</i>, and they both use the same overdriven electric guitar.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even then, I'd argue the similarities to 'Your Best Nightmare' persist: note how the long descent in the latter half of the <i>Vs. Susie</i> quote mirrors the higher leap in 'Your Best Nightmare'.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once again, although they are different in some ways, I argue that <i>Vs. Susie</i> definitely includes and expands upon the 'Your Best Nightmare' leitmotif.
					</p>
				
				<h3 id="ch2-36"><i>The Dark Truth</i></h3>
					<p>
						'Your Best Nightmare': 0:00-0:28
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/your-best-nightmare/ch2-36_ybn.mp3" controls></audio>
						<br>
						(See also: <a href="dont-forget.html">'Don't Forget'</a> and <a href="girl-next-door.html">'Girl Next Door'</a>)
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/your-best-nightmare_the-dark-truth.png" width="800px">
					<p>
						(Above: 'Your Best Nightmare' as heard in <i>Your Best Nightmare</i> ; below: the opening melody of <i>The Dark Truth</i>)
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that the echo is not included, as it doesn't really affect the validity of the quote, in my opinion.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this example, although the intervals are different (larger descent, larger leaps), the contour is maintained one to one, and so is the important structure of "descent, followed by a leap, which is then made bigger in the second repetition".
					</p>
					<p>
						This isn't to say the intervals aren't important - every example of this leitmotif thus far has maintained the [-1] intervals, so the fact that <i>The Dark Truth</i> 's quote has [-2] intervals is not to be ignored.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my opinion however, the structural arguments are simply too strong to ignore, and given how other examples in <i>Deltarune</i> use the motif to imply a more general sense of terror (such as the existential threat of the roaring), the context of the song works in the quote's favor as well.
					</p>
				
				<h3 id="ch2-37"><i>Digital Roots</i></h3>
					<p>
						'Your Best Nightmare': 0:00-0:16
						<br>
						<audio class="inline" src="../../assets/audio/motif-snippets/your-best-nightmare/ch2-37_ybn.mp3" controls></audio>
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>spamton_house.ogg</i> is an unused version of <i>Digital Roots</i> presumably intended to play in Spamton's shop, in place of <i>Dialtone</i>.
						<br>
						It's nearly identical to <i>Digital Roots</i>, and so it won't be covered here.
					</p>
					<p>
						For me, this quote is difficult to hear the exact notes for, and so I can't be one-hundred-percent confident of my transcription here.
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/images/motifs/your-best-nightmare_digital-roots.png" width="800px">
					<p>
						(Above: 'Your Best Nightmare' as heard in <i>Your Best Nightmare</i> ; below: the melody of <i>Digital Roots</i>)
					</p>
					<p>
						Once again, the ever so important structure is maintained, but with a notable difference in the contour:
						<br>
						<i>Digital Roots</i> has an extra note in each repetition, elongating the descents and leap ups, making the melody sound slurred overall.
					</p>
					<p>
						Obviously, with this, the intervals don't quite match up either; the only ones that can really be compared are the small descents, which do indeed maintain the [-1] interval as in 'Your Best Nightmare'.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, the context, like in <i>The Dark Truth</i>, adds up: it's a spooky leitmotif for a spooky area.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall, as I consider the structure to be the most important part of identifying this leitmotif, I believe this is an intentional connection.
						<br>
						It's definitely weaker than the others though, and I wouldn't be too surprised if it's unintentional.
